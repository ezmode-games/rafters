# Breadcrumb Component

Navigation is wayfinding. Every breadcrumb tells the story of how the user arrived at their current location, providing both context and a clear path back to safety.

Our breadcrumb system is built on the principle that spatial orientation should feel natural and trustworthy.

## Design Intelligence

- **Cognitive Load**: 2/10 (familiar wayfinding patterns)
- **Trust Building**: Clear escape routes reduce user anxiety
- **Attention Economics**: Subtle presence, prominent when needed
- **Spatial Intelligence**: Creates mental models of information architecture

## Wayfinding Principles

**Context First**: Users need to understand where they are in relation to the whole system. Breadcrumbs provide this spatial context instantly.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Only show the path that matters. Deep hierarchies can be intelligently collapsed to prevent cognitive overload.

**Escape Routes**: Every breadcrumb segment is a potential escape route. Users should feel confident they can navigate back to any point in their journey.

## When to Use

- Multi-level navigation hierarchies
- E-commerce category browsing
- Documentation with nested sections
- Form wizards and multi-step processes
- File system navigation

## When Not to Use

- Single-level pages without hierarchy
- Linear flows where back navigation is inappropriate
- Mobile contexts where space is extremely constrained

## Accessibility First

Breadcrumbs are navigational landmarks. They must be:
- Properly labeled with ARIA attributes
- Keyboard accessible with clear focus indicators
- Screen reader friendly with appropriate announcements
- Semantically structured as ordered lists

## Intelligence Features

- **Configurable Separators**: Choose from chevrons, slashes, pipes, or custom icons
- **Smart Truncation**: Automatic ellipsis for long hierarchies
- **Context Awareness**: Active state clearly shows current location
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with and without JavaScript
