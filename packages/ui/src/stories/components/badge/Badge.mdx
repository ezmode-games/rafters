# Badge Component

Status communication through systematic design intelligence. Badges provide instant recognition without cognitive overhead.

## Design Intelligence

Every interface needs status communication that works in peripheral vision. Our badge system delivers meaning through multiple sensory channels while respecting attention economics.

### Cognitive Load: 2/10
- **Base Load (1/10)**: Simple visual pattern recognition
- **Context Load (+1)**: Status meaning interpretation
- **Instant Recognition**: Status apparent within 100ms

### Multi-Sensory Communication
Never rely on color alone. Each status includes:
- **Color**: Semantic meaning (success = green, error = red)
- **Icon**: Universal symbols across languages
- **Text**: Clear, scannable labels
- **Pattern**: Visual weight matches importance

### Attention Economics
Badges consume precious cognitive resources. Use strategically:
- **Maximum 1 high-attention badge** per navigation section
- **2-3 medium-attention badges** maximum per viewport
- **Unlimited subtle badges** for status communication
- **Empty states preferred** over meaningless badges

## Usage Guidelines

<Canvas of={Stories.Primary} />

### DO
- Use semantic variants (success, warning, error, info, neutral)
- Apply appropriate emphasis for context (subtle, default, prominent)
- Include icons for multi-sensory communication
- Provide meaningful aria-labels for screen readers

### DON'T
- Use badges for primary actions
- Overwhelm interfaces with high-attention badges
- Rely solely on color for status communication
- Create badges without semantic meaning

## Trust Building
Consistent badge patterns build user confidence:
- Same status = same visual treatment
- Predictable icon + color combinations
- Clear interactive affordances when clickable
- Reliable removal patterns for dismissible badges
