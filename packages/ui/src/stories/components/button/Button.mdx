# Button
Buttons are used to show the user's choice of options for actions and assign these to a clear hierarchy. A button helps the user to find the most important actions of a page or within a viewport and enables them to perform these actions. The label is used to clearly indicate to the user what action will be triggered. Buttons allow users to commit a change, complete steps in a task, or make choices.

## Usage Guidelines
The primary button is used for the most important action on a page or in a view. The transparent secondary button with a thin frame is used for subordinate actions. The text button is applied as a subtle call to action.

#### DOs
- **Button Labels**
  - Must be clear and concise
  - Must describe the action that will be performed
  - Should include verbs to indicate action
  - Always include a noun to clarify the object of the action
- **Button Position**
  - Place primary buttons in the bottom right corner of a modal or form
  - Use consistent placement across similar components
  - Button groups always follow the same order: cancel, secondary, primary for modals and forms

#### DON'Ts
- **Button Labels**
  - Avoid vague labels like "Click here" or "Submit"
  - Don't use all caps for button text
  - Avoid using icons without text unless the action is universally understood icon
  - Do not use buttons for navigation links; use links instead
  - Do not use two primary buttons in the same context
  - Avoid using buttons for decorative purposes or non-interactive elements

#### Use Cases
- **Primary Actions**: Submit forms, save changes, confirm actions
- **Secondary Actions**: Cancel, edit, delete
- **Tertiary Actions**: View details, learn more, help links
- **Key Calls to Action**: Sign up, log in, download
- **Alongside Input**: Submit buttons next to input fields, action buttons like search or filter
