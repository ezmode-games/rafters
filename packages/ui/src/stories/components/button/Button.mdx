# Button

Every interaction begins with intent. The button is where user intention meets interface response. Our button system is built on the principle that clarity of purpose should be immediately apparent—both visually and functionally.

## Design Intelligence

**Cognitive Load**: 3/10 - Simple action triggers with embedded intelligence
**Trust Building**: Progressive confirmation for destructive actions reduces user anxiety
**Attention Economics**: Maximum 1 primary button per context to guide focus clearly

## Usage Guidelines

Buttons should communicate intent through carefully chosen visual hierarchy and semantic meaning. The component includes embedded UX intelligence for loading states, destructive confirmation, and attention hierarchy.

#### DOs
- **Attention Hierarchy**
  - Use primary buttons sparingly—maximum one per context
  - Reserve destructive variants for irreversible actions with consequences
  - Apply loading states during async operations to prevent double-submission
  - Size buttons according to importance (large=high attention, small=low attention)

- **Trust Building** 
  - Enable `destructiveConfirm` for dangerous actions (shows confirmation on first click)
  - Use clear, action-oriented labels ("Delete Account" not "Delete")
  - Provide proper disabled states when actions are unavailable
  - Include loading feedback for operations that take time

- **Semantic Clarity**
  - Choose variants that match consequence level (success=safe, warning=caution, destructive=dangerous)
  - Use outline/ghost for secondary actions that don't require attention
  - Apply consistent sizing within interface sections
  - Group related actions with proper spacing and alignment

#### NEVERs
- **Attention Economics**
  - Multiple primary buttons competing for attention in the same context
  - Destructive actions without confirmation or clear consequence explanation
  - Buttons without clear, action-oriented labels
  - Primary emphasis on low-priority or reversible actions

- **Interaction Patterns**
  - Missing loading states for async operations (leads to double-submission)
  - Destructive actions that activate immediately without confirmation
  - Disabled buttons without explanation of why they're unavailable
  - Inconsistent button sizing within the same interface section
