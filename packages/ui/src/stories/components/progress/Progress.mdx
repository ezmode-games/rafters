# Progress
Progress indicators communicate time and completion status for operations longer than 2 seconds. They transform waiting into understanding through intelligent time estimation and clear status feedback.

## Usage Guidelines
Progress indicators should match the real characteristics of work being performed. Choose patterns that build trust through accurate time estimation and honest visual feedback.

#### DOs
- **Time Estimation**
  - Use linear patterns for consistent operations (file transfers)
  - Use accelerating patterns for operations that speed up (downloads with caching)
  - Use decelerating patterns for complex finalization steps
  - Provide accurate time estimates based on current performance
- **Complexity Levels**
  - Use simple complexity for end users and casual operations
  - Use detailed complexity for professional tools and critical operations
  - Include pause/cancel controls for long-running user-initiated processes
  - Show step indicators for multi-phase operations

#### DON'Ts
- **Progress Patterns**
  - Never show fake progress to appear faster
  - Don't use progress for operations under 1 second
  - Avoid indeterminate spinners when progress can be measured
  - Don't provide inaccurate time estimates that destroy trust
- **Information Density**
  - Don't overwhelm users with unnecessary details in simple contexts
  - Avoid showing controls for system-critical operations that cannot be interrupted
  - Don't use progress for decorative animations without functional purpose

#### Use Cases
- **File Operations**: Upload, download, backup with pause/cancel controls
- **System Operations**: Installation, updates with step-by-step breakdown
- **Data Processing**: Analysis, imports with intelligent time estimation
- **Multi-step Workflows**: Setup, onboarding with clear phase indicators
