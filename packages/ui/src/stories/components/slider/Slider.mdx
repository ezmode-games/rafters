# Slider Component

Precision lives in the balance between control and simplicity. The slider transforms abstract values into tangible, manipulable representations—bridging the gap between human intuition and digital precision.

Our slider system is built on the principle that every interaction should feel naturally responsive while providing the accuracy users need for meaningful control.

## Design Intelligence

### Core Principles
- **Motor Accessibility First**: Enhanced touch targets and thumb sizes ensure universal usability
- **Precision with Context**: Value display and units provide immediate feedback for informed decisions  
- **Trust Through Responsiveness**: Instant visual feedback builds confidence in every adjustment
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Step indicators and value labels appear when precision matters

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Base Cognitive Load**: 5/10 (requires understanding current value and precision needs)
- **With Value Display**: Reduces to 3/10 (immediate feedback eliminates guesswork)
- **With Step Indicators**: Can increase to 7/10 (additional visual processing required)

The cognitive load varies significantly based on the precision requirements of the task. A volume slider requires minimal cognitive overhead, while a temperature control for medical equipment demands maximum precision and clarity.

### Trust Building Patterns
- **Immediate Visual Feedback**: Range fill updates in real-time during interaction
- **Clear Value Communication**: Optional value display with units for precision tasks
- **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent motion timing across all interactions
- **Accessible Labels**: ARIA labels provide context for assistive technologies

### Motor Accessibility Intelligence
- **Enhanced Touch Targets**: 44px minimum touch area on mobile, following iOS and Android guidelines
- **Thumb Size Options**: Default (20px) and large (24px) variants for different dexterity needs
- **Track Size Options**: Standard (8px) and large (12px) heights for easier targeting
- **Hover States**: 110% scale on hover provides clear interaction feedback

## When to Use Sliders

### Optimal Use Cases
- **Range Selection**: Choosing values within a defined range (volume, brightness, temperature)
- **Approximate Values**: When precise input matters less than quick adjustment
- **Real-time Preview**: Settings that benefit from immediate visual feedback
- **Bounded Ranges**: Clear minimum and maximum values that users understand

### Avoid Sliders When
- **Precise Input Required**: Use Input fields for exact values (phone numbers, IDs)
- **Unbounded Ranges**: No clear min/max creates cognitive confusion
- **Few Options**: 3-5 discrete choices work better as radio buttons
- **Critical Precision**: Financial amounts, medical dosages need explicit input

## Attention Economics

Sliders naturally draw attention through their interactive affordance. The slider track creates a visual "runway" that guides the eye, while the thumb position communicates current state at a glance.

### Hierarchy Guidelines
- **Primary Control**: Use for the most important value adjustment in a form
- **Supporting Controls**: Group related sliders with clear visual separation
- **Label Priority**: Value display should never compete with control interaction

## Usage with Design Intelligence

### Quick Decision Framework
1. **Motor Accessibility**: Who needs to use this control? Choose appropriate thumb and track sizes
2. **Precision Requirements**: Does the task need exact values? Show value display and units
3. **Context Understanding**: Will users benefit from step indicators? Enable for discrete value ranges
4. **Trust Building**: Always use motion tokens for responsive feedback

### Common Patterns
- **Settings Panels**: Volume, brightness, notification preferences
- **Filtering Interfaces**: Price ranges, date ranges, rating filters
- **Creative Tools**: Opacity, brush size, effect intensity
- **Data Visualization**: Time series scrubbing, threshold adjustment

## Progressive Enhancement

The slider is built with progressive enhancement at its core:

### Core Experience (Keyboard)
- Arrow keys adjust value by step amount
- Page Up/Down for larger increments  
- Home/End for min/max values
- Tab navigation between controls

### Enhanced Experience (Mouse/Touch)
- Drag interaction for continuous adjustment
- Click-to-position for quick jumps
- Hover states for interaction feedback
- Touch-optimized targets for mobile

## Semantic Token Integration

The slider leverages semantic design tokens for consistent behavior:

- **Motion Tokens**: `contextTiming.hover` and `contextEasing.hover` for responsive feedback
- **Color Tokens**: `bg-primary` for active range, `bg-secondary` for track
- **Space Tokens**: Systematic padding and margins for proper touch targets
- **Typography Tokens**: Value display uses monospace for consistent width

This systematic approach ensures sliders feel consistent across your entire interface while maintaining their unique interactive characteristics.
