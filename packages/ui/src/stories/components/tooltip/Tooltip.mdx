# Tooltip
Tooltips provide contextual information on demand without cluttering the interface. They bridge the gap between user uncertainty and interface clarity through contextual intelligence that adapts to user needs, content complexity, and interaction patterns.

## Usage Guidelines
Tooltips should enhance understanding rather than deliver essential information. They provide just-enough context precisely when users need it, with smart timing that prevents accidents while ensuring accessibility.

#### DOs
- **Content Guidelines**
  - Keep content brief and scannable (1-2 sentences maximum)
  - Provide value beyond what's already visible
  - Use for supplementary information that enhances understanding
  - Match the context type to the information being provided
- **Timing Intelligence**
  - Use auto-calculated delays based on content complexity and context
  - Essential information gets faster access (500ms)
  - Complex information gets longer delays (1200ms) to prevent accidents
  - Shortcuts get quick access for power users (300ms)
- **Accessibility**
  - Always provide keyboard access via Tab navigation
  - Use proper ARIA labeling for screen readers
  - Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
  - Provide alternative access methods for touch interfaces

#### DON'Ts
- **Content Guidelines**
  - Never put essential information only in tooltips
  - Avoid repeating visible text without adding value
  - Don't use for marketing content or promotional messages
  - Never replace proper error messages with tooltips
- **Interaction Patterns**
  - Don't use extremely short delays (< 200ms) that interrupt normal navigation
  - Avoid extremely long delays (> 2000ms) that frustrate help-seeking users
  - Don't rely solely on hover for touch interfaces
  - Never use tooltips for critical actions without alternative confirmation
