# Card

Information architecture begins with containment. The card is where related content finds its boundaries and relationships become clear. Our card system is built on the principle that content grouping should create immediate understanding of information hierarchy.

## Design Intelligence

**Cognitive Load**: 2/10 - Simple content containers with embedded spatial intelligence
**Trust Building**: Consistent visual hierarchy builds user confidence in information structure
**Attention Economics**: Cards create natural scanning patterns through spatial boundaries

## Usage Guidelines

Cards should group related information while maintaining clear visual hierarchy and spatial relationships. The component includes embedded intelligence for elevation, spacing, and content organization.

#### DOs
- **Information Architecture**
  - Group closely related content within single cards
  - Use elevation to indicate hierarchy and importance
  - Maintain consistent padding and spacing within card content
  - Apply hover states for interactive cards to indicate clickability

- **Content Organization** 
  - Lead with the most important information (headers, titles)
  - Use clear visual hierarchy within card content
  - Provide proper spacing between different content types
  - Include clear action areas when cards are interactive

- **Spatial Relationships**
  - Maintain consistent card sizing within the same context
  - Use appropriate gaps between cards in layouts
  - Apply semantic variants that match content purpose
  - Ensure cards work across different screen sizes

#### NEVERs
- **Content Structure**
  - Mixing unrelated information in a single card
  - Overcrowding cards with too much content
  - Inconsistent padding or spacing within card collections
  - Cards without clear content hierarchy

- **Interactive Patterns**
  - Clickable cards without proper hover feedback
  - Interactive cards without clear visual indicators
  - Cards that don't respond appropriately to user interaction
  - Inaccessible focus states for keyboard navigation
