# Card Component

Cards organize related content into focused, scannable containers. They create predictable content boundaries while supporting both static display and interactive behaviors.

## Design Philosophy

Cards excel at progressive disclosure - revealing information at appropriate levels of detail. They balance cognitive load through intelligent density management and clear visual hierarchy.

### Core Principles

**Container Intelligence**
Cards automatically adapt their presentation based on content type and context. Information density, visual prominence, and interaction patterns adjust to optimize cognitive load for each use case.

**Content Hierarchy**
Semantic heading levels and visual weight create clear information architecture. Primary content gets elevated prominence, while supporting details use appropriate secondary styling.

**Interaction Clarity**
Interactive cards provide clear affordances through hover states, elevation changes, and cursor feedback. Static cards maintain clean presentation without interaction hints.

## When to Use Cards

✅ **DO use cards when:**
- Grouping related information that belongs together
- Creating scannable collections of similar content types
- Displaying content that might need different interaction levels
- Organizing dashboard widgets or content previews
- Building content that needs clear visual boundaries

❌ **DON'T use cards when:**
- Content flows naturally as continuous text
- Information doesn't need visual separation
- Building primary navigation elements
- Content is too simple for containerization
- Forcing unnecessary visual complexity

## Content Organization

Cards work best when they contain complete, self-contained pieces of information. Each card should:

- Have a clear purpose and focus
- Contain related information that belongs together
- Provide appropriate detail level for the context
- Support the user's scanning and decision-making patterns

### Information Architecture

```
Card Structure:
├── Header (title, description, metadata)
├── Content (primary information, media, data)
└── Footer (actions, timestamps, navigation)
```

Each section serves specific cognitive functions:
- **Header**: Establishes context and hierarchy
- **Content**: Delivers primary information efficiently  
- **Footer**: Provides actions and supplementary details

## Adaptive Density

Cards automatically adjust information density based on:

- **Compact**: High-density widgets, dashboards, summary views
- **Comfortable**: Standard content cards, article previews
- **Spacious**: Featured content, detailed information, focus areas

This density intelligence reduces cognitive load by matching presentation to content importance and available space.

## Interactive Patterns

### Static Cards
Display information without interaction requirements. Focus on clear hierarchy and efficient information delivery.

### Interactive Cards
Provide clear interaction affordances:
- Hover states with subtle elevation and opacity changes
- Cursor feedback indicating clickable areas
- Visual emphasis on interactive elements
- Clear action indicators in footers

### Collection Behaviors
When cards appear in collections, they maintain:
- Consistent interaction patterns within the group
- Clear visual relationships between related cards
- Appropriate spacing for touch and mouse interaction
- Predictable behavior across similar content types

Cards create trustworthy information containers that respect user attention and cognitive resources while supporting efficient content discovery and interaction.
