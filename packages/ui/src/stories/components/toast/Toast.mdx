# Toast
Toast notifications provide immediate confirmation that builds user confidence through intelligent timing and dismissal patterns. They appear at exactly the right moment and disappear gracefully without disrupting workflow.

<Canvas of={Stories.Common} />

## Usage Guidelines
Toast notifications should match the urgency and consequence level of the action being confirmed. Choose timing patterns that build trust through appropriate attention levels and dismissal behavior.

#### DOs
- **Timing Intelligence**
  - Use 3-second auto-dismiss for low urgency notifications (drafts saved, casual confirmations)
  - Use 5-second auto-dismiss for standard confirmations (file uploaded, action completed)
  - Use 8-second auto-dismiss for high urgency alerts (warnings, session expiring)
  - Use persistent toasts for errors requiring user acknowledgment
- **Semantic Meaning**
  - Use success variant for positive confirmations that build confidence
  - Use warning variant for caution needed with recovery actions
  - Use error variant for problems with clear next steps
  - Include action buttons for recoverable errors and time-sensitive warnings

#### DON'Ts
- **Attention Management**
  - Never show multiple simultaneous toasts (creates cognitive overload)
  - Don't use toasts for critical information that shouldn't disappear
  - Avoid using toasts for primary navigation or persistent interface elements
  - Don't interrupt users with demanding toasts for low-consequence actions
- **Content Guidelines**
  - Don't put complex information that requires thoughtful reading time
  - Avoid generic messages like "Success!" without context
  - Don't use persistent toasts for routine confirmations
  - Never use destructive variant for non-critical issues

#### Use Cases
- **Action Confirmations**: Save, delete, send successful with appropriate urgency timing
- **Error Recovery**: Network failures, validation errors with retry actions
- **Status Updates**: Non-blocking information users should notice briefly
- **Time-sensitive Alerts**: Session expiring, temporary system issues with extend/retry options
