# Toast Component

Feedback delivered at exactly the right moment. Toast notifications provide immediate confirmation that builds user confidence in their actions.

## Design Intelligence

**Cognitive Load: 2/10** - Brief, non-blocking notification that respects user attention  
**Trust Building: Critical** - Immediate feedback for user actions builds confidence  
**Attention Economics: Temporal** - Appears briefly, then gracefully disappears  

## Core Principles

### Timing Intelligence
- **Low urgency**: 3 seconds (casual notifications)
- **Medium urgency**: 5 seconds (standard confirmations)  
- **High urgency**: 8 seconds (important alerts)
- **Persistent**: Until manually dismissed (errors, critical actions)

### Interruption Behavior
- **Polite**: Subtle appearance, non-disruptive
- **Assertive**: Standard notification level
- **Demanding**: Forces user attention (errors only)

### Trust Building Patterns
- **Success confirmations** build confidence in completed actions
- **Error recovery** provides clear next steps for failures  
- **Auto-dismiss timing** respects cognitive load and urgency level
- **Manual dismiss option** gives users control over their attention

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ When to Use
- Action confirmation (save, delete, send successful)
- Error feedback with recovery options
- Status updates that don't require interaction
- Temporary information that users should notice

### ❌ When Not to Use  
- Critical information that shouldn't disappear
- Multiple simultaneous messages (creates cognitive overload)
- Primary navigation or persistent interface elements
- Information that requires thoughtful reading time

## Semantic Variants

Each variant carries semantic meaning and appropriate visual weight:

- **Default**: Neutral information, medium attention
- **Success**: Positive confirmation, builds trust
- **Warning**: Caution needed, medium urgency
- **Error**: Problem occurred, high attention, often persistent
- **Destructive**: Critical system issues, demanding attention

The Toast component automatically applies appropriate timing, styling, and behavior based on the semantic variant chosen.
