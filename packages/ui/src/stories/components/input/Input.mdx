# Input

Input components reduce user anxiety and increase confidence through intelligent validation patterns, trust-building visual cues, and error prevention strategies. Built on the principle that form inputs should feel safe and supportive, especially when handling sensitive information.

## Usage Guidelines

Input components should guide users toward successful form completion through intelligent validation timing, clear feedback, and trust-building patterns. The primary purpose is to prevent errors rather than just report them, creating a supportive data entry experience.

#### DOs
- **Error Prevention**
  - Use progressive validation that guides rather than interrupts
  - Provide format hints and examples in placeholder text
  - Show success states to build confidence as users progress
  - Enable auto-formatting for structured data (phone, credit card)
- **Trust Building**
  - Enhance visual styling for sensitive data fields
  - Use clear, non-judgmental validation messages
  - Provide immediate positive feedback for correct input
  - Show security indicators for password and financial fields
- **Accessibility Excellence**
  - Ensure minimum 44px touch targets on mobile devices
  - Use appropriate input types for better mobile keyboards
  - Provide clear labels and helpful validation messages
  - Implement proper ARIA relationships for screen readers

#### DON'Ts
- **User Anxiety**
  - Don't show errors immediately on focus or first keystroke
  - Avoid harsh or judgmental language in error messages
  - Don't clear valid input when showing unrelated errors
  - Never hide or disable paste functionality for password fields
- **Trust Violations**
  - Don't use unclear or misleading placeholder text
  - Avoid showing passwords in plain text without explicit user action
  - Don't submit or validate data without user consent
  - Never ignore accessibility requirements for motor or cognitive disabilities
- **Validation Confusion**
  - Don't show conflicting success and error states simultaneously
  - Avoid overly complex validation rules without clear explanation
  - Don't trigger validation during active typing for complex formats
  - Never rely solely on color to communicate validation state

#### Use Cases
- **Form Data Entry**: User registration, contact forms, profile updates
- **Financial Information**: Payment processing, banking details, billing addresses
- **Authentication**: Login forms, password creation, security questions
- **Search and Filtering**: Search boxes, filter inputs, query builders
- **Content Creation**: Text input, comment fields, message composition

#### Trust Levels
- **Low**: Basic text fields, search inputs, optional information
- **Medium**: Email addresses, phone numbers, required form fields
- **High**: Password fields, financial data, legal information
- **Critical**: Social security numbers, passport data, medical information
