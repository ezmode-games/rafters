# Chip

Context in miniature. The chip component transforms complex information into digestible, actionable tokens that users can scan, filter, and interact with at a glance.

## Design Intelligence

**Cognitive Load**: 1/10 - Minimal cognitive overhead with instant recognition
**Trust Building**: Consistent visual language builds confidence in system interactions
**Attention Economics**: Small but distinct, commands appropriate attention without overwhelming

## Usage Guidelines

Chips should represent discrete pieces of information or actions in a scannable, consistent format. Perfect for tags, filters, status indicators, and selection controls.

#### DOs
- **Information Architecture**
  - Use for discrete, related items that users need to scan quickly
  - Group related chips with consistent sizing and spacing
  - Provide clear visual distinction between different chip types
  - Include proper interactive feedback for actionable chips

- **Content Organization** 
  - Keep chip labels concise and scannable
  - Use semantic variants to communicate different types of information
  - Ensure removable chips have clear deletion affordances
  - Group chips in logical collections with appropriate spacing

#### NEVERs
- **Content Structure**
  - Long text that makes chips difficult to scan
  - Mixing interactive and non-interactive chips without clear distinction
  - Inconsistent sizing within the same chip collection
  - Missing visual feedback for interactive states
