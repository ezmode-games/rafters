# Motion

Motion creates meaning. Every animation in our system serves a purpose: building trust, guiding attention, and reducing cognitive load through thoughtful timing and easing curves.

## Design Intelligence

**Cognitive Load**: 1-9/10 - Variable based on motion complexity and frequency
**Trust Building**: Predictable, purposeful motion builds confidence in system reliability  
**Attention Economics**: Motion directs focus to what matters most, when it matters

## Motion Philosophy

Motion in digital interfaces should feel natural, purposeful, and respectful of user needs. Our motion system is built on three core principles:

### 1. Purposeful Animation
Every motion serves a specific function:
- **Feedback**: Confirming user actions and system responses
- **Guidance**: Directing attention and explaining spatial relationships
- **Continuity**: Maintaining context during state changes and transitions

### 2. Cognitive Load Awareness
Motion timing directly affects mental processing:
- **Instant (75ms)**: Immediate response for high-frequency interactions
- **Fast (150ms)**: Quick feedback for standard interactive elements
- **Standard (300ms)**: Balanced timing for most transitions
- **Deliberate (500ms)**: Thoughtful pacing for important changes
- **Slow (700ms)**: Graceful timing for large UI changes  
- **Dramatic (1000ms)**: Maximum impact for critical moments

### 3. Accessibility First
Our motion system respects user preferences and accessibility needs:
- Automatic `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- High contrast compatibility
- Keyboard navigation optimization
- Screen reader friendly implementations

## Usage Guidelines

#### DOs
- **Purposeful Motion**
  - Use motion to explain spatial relationships and cause-and-effect
  - Match motion timing to interaction consequence level
  - Apply consistent easing curves for similar interaction types
  - Provide immediate feedback for all interactive elements

- **Trust Building**
  - Use smooth, predictable motion for routine interactions
  - Apply deliberate timing for high-consequence actions
  - Ensure motion supports rather than distracts from content
  - Test motion with various device performance levels

#### NEVERs
- **Cognitive Overload**
  - Multiple simultaneous animations competing for attention
  - Motion that contradicts user expectations or mental models
  - Animations longer than necessary for the interaction context
  - Motion without clear purpose or functional benefit

- **Accessibility Violations**
  - Ignoring `prefers-reduced-motion` user preferences
  - Motion that triggers vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity
  - Critical functionality that depends solely on motion
  - Animations that interfere with keyboard or screen reader navigation
