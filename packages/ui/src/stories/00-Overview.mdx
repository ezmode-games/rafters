# Design Intelligence System for AI Agents

Components contain embedded human design reasoning that enables AI agents to make informed UX decisions and create exceptional user experiences.

## The Human-AI Design Flow

### 1. Humans Create Intent
Define design systems with embedded meaning and usage rules

### 2. System Generates Intelligence
Components carry human design reasoning in machine-readable formats

### 3. AI Agents Apply Intelligence
Read component metadata to make informed UX decisions

### 4. Users Benefit
Get consistent, accessible, thoughtfully designed experiences

## Core Principles

### Design Intelligence
Every component includes cognitive load ratings, trust-building requirements, and accessibility intelligence that AI agents can read and apply.

### Contextual Adaptation
Components understand their usage context — from shortcuts (300ms delay) to complex information (1200ms delay) — and adapt accordingly.

### Trust Building
Systematic patterns reduce user anxiety through appropriate friction, progressive disclosure, and clear escape hatches for critical actions.

### Accessibility First
WCAG AAA compliance isn't added later — it's embedded in component intelligence from the start.

Enable AI agents to understand and apply human design expertise systematically, creating better user experiences through embedded design intelligence rather than guesswork.
