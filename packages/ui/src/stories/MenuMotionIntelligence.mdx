# Menu Motion Intelligence Guide

Motion intelligence patterns for compositional menu architecture: DropdownMenu, NavigationMenu, ContextMenu, and BreadcrumbMenu integration.

## Executive Summary

Your compositional menu architecture requires coordinated motion intelligence that respects cognitive load, attention economics, and trust-building principles. Each menu type serves distinct interaction contexts and must work harmoniously when active simultaneously.

## Motion Coordination Framework

### Primary Principle: Attention Isolation

Only **one menu type** should command primary attention through motion at any given moment. Secondary motion should support without competing.

### Cognitive Load Budget System

- **Total Interface Budget**: 15 cognitive load points maximum
- **Active Menu Allocation**: 8-10 points (primary focus)
- **Supporting Elements**: 3-5 points (secondary awareness)
- **Reserve Capacity**: 2 points (emergency feedback)

### Motion Priority Hierarchy

1. **ContextMenu** - Highest priority (immediate user intent)
2. **NavigationMenu** - High priority (task-critical navigation)
3. **DropdownMenu** - Medium priority (tool access)
4. **BreadcrumbMenu** - Lowest priority (wayfinding support)

## Component-Specific Motion Patterns

### DropdownMenu Motion Intelligence

**Design Challenge**: Must serve both dropdown and accordion use cases with motion that works for both contexts.

**Unified Motion Pattern**:
```typescript
// Universal reveal pattern for both dropdown and accordion
const dropdownMotion = {
  timing: contextTiming.modal, // 300ms - balanced for both contexts
  easing: contextEasing.modalEnter, // Welcoming appearance
  cognitiveLoad: 4, // Medium impact
  trustLevel: 'medium',
  
  // Dropdown-specific (overlay positioning)
  dropdownTransform: 'opacity-0 scale-95 translate-y-1',
  dropdownEnter: 'opacity-100 scale-100 translate-y-0',
  
  // Accordion-specific (in-place expansion)  
  accordionTransform: 'opacity-0 max-h-0',
  accordionEnter: 'opacity-100 max-h-screen'
}
```

**Key Insights**:
- **Common Timing**: 300ms works for both dropdown appearance and accordion expansion
- **Contextual Transforms**: Different transforms for overlay vs. in-place behavior
- **Shared Personality**: Welcoming entrance reduces anxiety in both contexts
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion collapses to 0ms for both patterns

### NavigationMenu Motion Intelligence (Recursive)

**Design Challenge**: Handle nested submenu motion without overwhelming users or causing motion sickness.

**Depth-Aware Motion System**:
```typescript
const navigationMotion = {
  // Base timing scales with depth to prevent cascading chaos
  getTimingForDepth: (depth: number) => {
    const baseTiming = 200; // Faster than modals
    const depthPenalty = Math.min(depth * 50, 150); // Max 150ms penalty
    return Math.min(baseTiming + depthPenalty, 400); // Cap at 400ms
  },
  
  // Depth-aware cognitive load
  getCognitiveLoadForDepth: (depth: number) => {
    return Math.min(3 + depth, 7); // Increases with depth, capped at 7
  },
  
  // Staggered entrance for submenu items
  itemStagger: 50, // 50ms between item appearances
  maxStagger: 200, // Don't exceed 200ms total stagger
}
```

**Recursive Motion Strategy**:
- **Timing Graduation**: Each level gets slightly slower to prevent cascading chaos
- **Transform Reduction**: Deeper levels use more subtle transforms
- **Staggered Entrance**: Menu items appear sequentially, not simultaneously
- **Cognitive Load Awareness**: Deeper menus automatically respect higher cognitive load

### ContextMenu Motion Intelligence

**Design Challenge**: Needs immediate attention-grabbing motion without being jarring.

**Immediate Response Pattern**:
```typescript
const contextMenuMotion = {
  timing: contextTiming.fast, // 150ms - immediate response
  easing: contextEasing.snappy, // Sharp feedback for user-initiated action
  cognitiveLoad: 5, // Higher than other menus due to interruption
  trustLevel: 'high', // Must feel responsive and reliable
  
  // Attention-grabbing but not jarring
  entryTransform: 'opacity-0 scale-90 translate-y-2',
  entryTarget: 'opacity-100 scale-100 translate-y-0',
  
  // Quick exit to not interfere with user's next action
  exitTiming: contextTiming.instant, // 75ms
  exitEasing: contextEasing.decelerating,
  exitTransform: 'opacity-0 scale-95'
}
```

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Priority Override**: Context menus can interrupt other menu motion
- **Immediate Feedback**: Must appear within 150ms of user action
- **Quick Dismissal**: Fast exit to minimize interference with next action
- **Position-Aware**: Motion adapts to available screen space

### BreadcrumbMenu Motion Intelligence

**Design Challenge**: Provide subtle wayfinding motion that doesn't compete with primary content.

**Subtle Wayfinding Pattern**:
```typescript
const breadcrumbMotion = {
  timing: contextTiming.hover, // 75ms - immediate feedback
  easing: contextEasing.smooth, // Natural, unobtrusive
  cognitiveLoad: 1, // Minimal impact on user attention
  trustLevel: 'high', // Reliable wayfinding builds trust
  
  // Hover feedback (very subtle)
  hoverTransform: 'text-muted-foreground',
  hoverTarget: 'text-foreground',
  
  // New segment addition (when navigation occurs)
  segmentEntry: {
    timing: contextTiming.standard, // 300ms
    transform: 'opacity-0 translate-x-4',
    target: 'opacity-100 translate-x-0'
  }
}
```

**Wayfinding Intelligence**:
- **Background Presence**: Motion should support, never demand attention
- **Contextual Enhancement**: Slightly more prominent in error/critical contexts
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Ellipsis expansion uses welcoming animation
- **Trust Building**: Consistent, predictable motion builds navigation confidence

## Reduced Motion Strategy

**WCAG AAA Compliance Approach**:
- **0ms Durations**: No micro-flash effects that trigger vestibular issues
- **Essential Motion Only**: Focus indicators and state feedback remain
- **Alternative Feedback**: Use color/text changes instead of transforms
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Enhanced motion for users who can handle it

## Conclusion

This motion intelligence framework provides systematic guidance for creating cohesive, accessible, and trustworthy menu interactions. The key principles are:

1. **Attention Isolation**: Only one menu type commands primary attention
2. **Cognitive Load Management**: Respect the 15-point interface budget
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Base functionality works without motion
4. **Trust Building**: Consistent, predictable motion personality
5. **Accessibility First**: 0ms durations and alternative feedback for reduced motion users

By following these patterns, AI agents can create menu experiences that feel coordinated, reduce user anxiety, and build trust through systematic design intelligence.
