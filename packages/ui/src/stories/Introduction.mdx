# Rafters Design System

Rafters is a trust-building component system designed for consequential interfaces. Built on the principle that design decisions should reduce cognitive load and increase user confidence, especially during critical moments.

## Philosophy

**Trust-building through intelligence.** Every component in Rafters implements three layers of intelligence:

1. **Visual Intelligence** - Progressive visual hierarchy based on consequence and trust levels
2. **Behavioral Intelligence** - Smart defaults and adaptive patterns that guide users naturally 
3. **Accessibility Intelligence** - Universal design that works for everyone, not just compliance

## Component Architecture

Each component follows a comprehensive **7-file pattern** that ensures consistency, depth, and maintainability:

### 📖 ComponentName.mdx
**Overview Documentation**
- Component purpose and design philosophy
- Usage guidelines with clear DOs and DON'Ts
- Real-world use cases and contexts
- Trust levels and consequence mapping

### 🎯 ComponentName.stories.tsx
**Primary Story File**
- Single "Common" story showcasing all major variants
- Comprehensive argTypes for all component props
- Interactive controls for rapid prototyping
- Core component demonstration

### ♿ ComponentNameAccessibility.stories.tsx
**Accessibility Patterns**
- Foundation accessibility principles
- Keyboard navigation demonstrations
- Screen reader optimization examples
- Color contrast and universal design
- WCAG compliance patterns

### 🧠 ComponentNameIntelligence.stories.tsx
**Smart Behaviors**
- Trust-building patterns and progressive confirmation
- Attention hierarchy demonstrations
- Cognitive load optimization
- Context-aware adaptations
- Loading states and feedback patterns

### ⚙️ ComponentNameProperties.stories.tsx
**Properties & States**
- Size variants and scaling relationships
- State demonstrations (disabled, loading, error)
- Interactive feedback patterns
- Composition capabilities
- Property combinations

### 🎨 ComponentNameSemantic.stories.tsx
**Semantic Meaning**
- Semantic variants (success, warning, error, info)
- Contextual usage examples
- Meaning communication through design
- Trust level implementations
- Consequence-appropriate styling

### 🎭 ComponentNameVariants.stories.tsx
**Visual Variants**
- Style variants and visual treatments
- Emphasis levels and hierarchy
- Confirmation patterns
- Layout adaptations
- Comparison demonstrations

## Trust-Building Principles

### Progressive Trust Levels

Every component implements four trust levels that match user psychology:

- **Low Trust** - Routine actions, minimal friction, reversible
- **Medium Trust** - Moderate consequences, balanced caution
- **High Trust** - Significant impact, deliberate friction
- **Critical Trust** - Permanent consequences, maximum friction

### Attention Economics

Visual hierarchy follows consequence severity:
- Primary actions get strongest visual weight
- Secondary actions provide clear alternatives  
- Escape routes are always clearly available
- Destructive actions require appropriate friction

### Cognitive Load Management

Information architecture reduces mental overhead:
- Progressive disclosure for complex interactions
- Clear information hierarchy
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Contextual help and guidance

## Implementation Examples

### Button Component
**Trust-building through visual hierarchy**
```tsx
// Low-stakes action
<Button variant="outline" size="sm">Save Draft</Button>

// High-stakes action  
<Button variant="destructive" destructiveConfirm>Delete Account</Button>
```

### Dialog Component
**Progressive confirmation for critical actions**
```tsx
// Critical trust level with enhanced confirmation
<Dialog trustLevel="critical" destructive>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogTitle>Delete Account Forever</DialogTitle>
    <DialogDescription>
      This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete 
      your account and all data.
    </DialogDescription>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

## Design Tokens

All components use semantic design tokens that communicate meaning:

- **Colors** - Semantic meaning over aesthetic preference
- **Spacing** - Cognitive breathing room and information hierarchy  
- **Typography** - Clear information architecture
- **Motion** - Purposeful feedback and state communication

## Development Workflow

### Component Creation Process

1. **Define Trust Context** - What are the consequences of this interaction?
2. **Map User Journey** - Where does anxiety exist? How can we reduce it?
3. **Implement 7-File Pattern** - Complete documentation and story coverage
4. **Test Accessibility** - Ensure universal usability
5. **Validate Trust Patterns** - Does it feel safe and clear?

### Quality Standards

Every component must demonstrate:
- ✅ Complete 7-file story pattern
- ✅ WCAG AAA accessibility compliance
- ✅ Trust-appropriate visual hierarchy
- ✅ Progressive confirmation for destructive actions
- ✅ Clear escape routes and undo patterns
- ✅ Responsive and inclusive design

## Getting Started

### For Designers
Start with the **ComponentName.mdx** files to understand usage patterns and design principles. Review the **Semantic** and **Variants** stories to see how meaning is communicated through design.

### For Developers  
Begin with the **ComponentName.stories.tsx** file for implementation examples. Check **Properties** and **Intelligence** stories for advanced patterns and behaviors.

### For QA/Accessibility
Focus on **Accessibility** stories for testing patterns. Review **Intelligence** stories for complex interaction flows and edge cases.
