Here's the real story.\n\n### The Problem: AI Has No Taste\n\nWe tried everything to teach AI good design. Built scrapers that collected the top 15,000 websites and their CSS. Fed massive vector databases full of design examples to AI models. Documented every design principle we could think of. Prompts that explained color theory, typography, layout, and accessibility.\n\nAI agents didn't care. The agent would rush in, pattern match on surface-level similarities, and generate interfaces that looked technically correct but felt completely wrong. Bad spacing. Poor hierarchy. Accessibility violations. No sense of rhythm or proportion.\n\nBy the time anyone realized the AI had made a mess, it was too late. The damage was done. Hours or days wasted. WCAG or Section 508? Forget it.\n\nTraditional design systems provide components without reasoning. AI agents cannot distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate usage contexts. Basic UI component systems? Forget it. They just make things worse by giving AI more options to choose from without any guidance.\n\n### Insight: Stop Trying to Teach Taste, Embed It\n\nWe realized we were solving the wrong problem. Instead of trying to teach AI aesthetic judgment (which may never work), we decided to embed human design intelligence directly into the system itself.\n\nRafters embeds human design reasoning directly into component metadata. Each component includes:\n\n- **Cognitive load ratings** (0-10 scale): Mental effort required from users\n- **Trust level indicators**: Critical, high, medium, low reliability requirements\n- **Accessibility compliance**: WCAG AA/AAA validation with contrast ratios\n- **Usage context rules**: When to apply each component variant\n- **Mathematical relationships**: Spacing scales, typography ratios, color harmonies\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n**Default safety**: Mathematical spacing systems and semantic color tokens prevent basic layout failures. Container and grid components handle structural requirements automatically.\n\n**Intelligence on demand**: When implementation decisions require human judgment, query component metadata for cognitive load impacts, trust requirements, and usage patterns. No guessing required.\n\n**Validation rules**: Built-in constraints prevent accessibility violations and maintain visual hierarchy.\n\n**MCP Server**: When the AI agent is unsure, it can query the MCP server for recommendations based on embedded design intelligence and the deep token context of the current project.\n\n### Operational Benefits\n\nAI agents implement functional interfaces without design expertise, then access embedded intelligence for optimization decisions. System prevents common failure modes while preserving access to human design reasoning.\n\nQuality degrades gracefully. Even minimal implementations maintain baseline usability standards.\n\nHumans apply taste and brand via the Studio to create intent. Studio records the reasoning behind every design decision, which is then embedded into the component and token registry for AI consumption.\n\n### Why \"Rafters\"?\n\nRafters provide structural support in structures;essential infrastructure that enables everything built above. Similarly, this design system provides foundational intelligence that supports interface generation without requiring explicit design knowledge.\n\n\u003CFAQSection\n  description=\"Common questions about Rafters, the AI-first design system\"\n>\n  \u003CFAQ question=\"Wait, what's Rafters again?\">\n    It's a design system built for AI agents. Instead of just giving you components, we capture the design reasoning behind every decision and make it machine-readable.\n\n    When AI builds interfaces using Rafters, it doesn't guess; it reads the embedded intelligence about cognitive load, attention economics, and trust patterns.\n  \u003C/FAQ>\n\n  \u003CFAQ question=\"How is this different from shadcn/ui?\">\n    shadcn/ui is a collection of copy-paste components. Rafters is a design system—a comprehensive set of standards, components, patterns, and guidelines that work together as a cohesive system.\n\n    Design systems provide the \"why\" behind design decisions, not just the \"what.\" Rafters takes this further by encoding design reasoning into machine-readable metadata that AI agents can understand and apply systematically.\n\n    Every component includes cognitive load ratings, attention economics patterns, and trust-building requirements. This embedded intelligence helps maintain design consistency and user experience quality at scale.\n  \u003C/FAQ>\n\n  \u003CFAQ question=\"What's with the cognitive load ratings?\">\n    Every component gets a rating from 0-10 based on how much mental effort it requires. A Container is 0/10 (invisible structure), a Button is 3/10 (simple action), a Dialog is 6/10 (interrupts flow).\n\n    AI agents can use these ratings to build interfaces that respect users' cognitive capacity and avoid overwhelming them.\n  \u003C/FAQ>\n\n  \u003CFAQ question=\"Can I use this without AI?\">\n    Absolutely! The components work perfectly for human developers too. The embedded intelligence just makes the design decisions more explicit and systematic.\n\n    Think of it as documentation that never gets out of sync because it's built into the components themselves.\n  \u003C/FAQ>\n\n  \u003CFAQ question=\"What's in the registry?\">\n    Component code, design intelligence metadata, usage patterns, accessibility requirements, and examples. Everything an AI agent needs to understand how to use components appropriately.\n\n    Check out [llms.txt](/llms.txt) for the AI-focused documentation, or browse the [component docs](/docs) for human-readable explanations.\n  \u003C/FAQ>\n\u003C/FAQSection>\n\n## Still confused?\n\nThat's fair. We're trying to solve a problem most people don't even know exists yet. AI-generated interfaces are about to flood the world, and most of them are going to be terrible.\n\n#### Rafters is our attempt to fix that before it becomes everyone's problem.","src/content/pages/huh.mdx","f422b6abd31ffd66","huh.mdx","index",{"id":34,"data":36,"body":40,"filePath":41,"digest":42,"legacyId":43,"deferredRender":21},{"pageLayout":25,"title":37,"description":38,"headerTitle":39,"headerTitleClasses":29},"Rafters – AI-first design system","Install AI-first design system components with embedded intelligence","Your AI-First Design System","Designers pick a color. We handle the math. AI agents build interfaces that actually work.\n\nNo more guessing what button variant to use. No more wondering if colors have enough contrast. No more AI-generated UIs that look like garbage.\n\nRafters captures why designers make decisions, not just what they chose. When you override our mathematical color scale because \"the blue needs more pop,\" we remember that. When AI builds the next interface, it knows your brand needs that extra saturation.\n\nStart with grayscale. Add your taste. Ship accessible interfaces. It's that simple.\n\n## Get Started\n\nInitialize Rafters in your project:\n\n```bash\nnpx rafters init\n```\nAdd your first component:\n\n```bash\nnpx rafters add button\n```\n\nThat's it. You now have a mathematically-sound, AI-readable design system. Components work immediately with grayscale defaults. Run Studio later to add your brand personality.\n\n\n## But shadcn/ui! \nYou might be thinking, \"Wait, shadcn/ui already does this!\" And you're right. Sort of.\n\n**shadcn/ui isn't a design system. It's a component library. Big difference.**\n\nshadcn gives you beautiful, accessible React components. You still need to figure out your colors, your spacing scale, your typography ratios, when to use what variant, and why. Every team using shadcn makes different decisions. That's fine if you have a designer. It's chaos when AI is building your interfaces.\n\nRafters is an actual design system built for AI agents. Mathematical design rules (golden ratios, OKLCH color science, Miller's Law) get serialized into JSON. Your designer's choices get captured as structured data. Best practices become machine-readable standards. Components ship with a registry that tells agents exactly when to use what, why, and how.\n\nThis isn't documentation for humans to read. It's a structured knowledge base that AI agents consume. Every design decision - from your brand's specific blue to why buttons need 44px touch targets - lives in a format that machines understand and Git tracks. Your AI doesn't guess what button to use; it reads the registry and knows.\n\n## Comparison\n\n| shadcn/ui | Rafters |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Copy/paste components | **Everything shadcn has, plus:** |\n| Own your code | JSON registry AI agents can read |\n| Tailwind styling | Mathematical design rules serialized |\n| Dark mode | Human choices as structured data |\n| TypeScript | Machine-readable best practices |\n| Radix UI primitives | Component usage standards in .rafters/ |\n| Manual customization | Git-tracked human design decisions |\n| | WCAG AAA compliance built-in |","src/content/pages/index.mdx","311b0307882f031f","index.mdx","registry",{"id":44,"data":46,"body":50,"filePath":51,"digest":52,"legacyId":53,"deferredRender":21},{"pageLayout":11,"title":47,"description":48,"headerTitle":49,"headerTitleClasses":29},"Component Registry – Rafters","Browse and explore Rafters design system components with embedded intelligence","Component Registry","import ComponentRegistryGrid from '../../components/ComponentRegistryGrid.astro';\n\nExplore the complete catalog of Rafters components with embedded design intelligence.

Every color choice is based on measurable principles rather than arbitrary aesthetic decisions.\n\n## OKLCH Color Space\n\n### Why OKLCH Over RGB/HSL?\n\n**OKLCH is perceptually uniform** - equal numeric changes produce equal visual changes across all colors:\n\n- **L=50 always looks like 50% brightness** regardless of hue (red, blue, green all appear equally bright)\n- **C=0.15 produces identical saturation levels** across all hues  \n- **Hue rotation maintains consistent lightness** (no brightness shifts when changing colors)\n\nThis predictability helps designers and AI agents understand the systematic relationships between colors.\n\n### Visual Consistency Example\n\n```css\n/* These three colors have identical visual brightness and saturation */\noklch(60% 0.15 0)    /* Red */\noklch(60% 0.15 120)  /* Green */  \noklch(60% 0.15 240)  /* Blue */\n```\n\nIn RGB, achieving this visual consistency would require different values for each hue due to perceptual differences in how humans see red vs blue vs green.\n\n## Mathematical Color Relationships\n\n### Color Harmony Theory\n\nRafters generates harmonious color palettes using mathematical relationships:\n\n**Complementary** (180° apart):\n- Creates maximum contrast without visual clash\n- Ideal for primary/accent color pairings\n- Example: Blue (240°) + Orange (60°)\n\n**Triadic** (120° apart):\n- Three colors with balanced visual weight\n- Provides variety while maintaining harmony\n- Example: Red (0°) + Green (120°) + Blue (240°)\n\n**Analogous** (30° apart):\n- Creates subtle, sophisticated color progressions\n- Perfect for gradient backgrounds and subtle variations\n- Example: Blue (240°) → Blue-Purple (270°) → Purple (300°)\n\n### Perceptual Color Weights\n\nDifferent hues have different visual weights even at identical lightness and chroma:\n\n1. **Red** - Heaviest visual weight, advances toward viewer\n2. **Orange** - Warm, energetic, attention-grabbing\n3. **Yellow** - Bright, optimistic, expands visually\n4. **Green** - Balanced, natural, restful to eyes\n5. **Blue** - Cool, recedes, trustworthy\n6. **Purple** - Lightest weight, sophisticated\n\nDesigners can use these weights to create proper visual hierarchy - heavy colors for important elements, light colors for backgrounds. AI agents can understand and respect these hierarchies when implementing designs.\n\n## Accessibility Through Mathematics\n\n### Systematic Contrast Ratios\n\nInstead of guessing which colors work together, Rafters pre-calculates all valid combinations:\n\n**WCAG AA Standard (4.5:1 contrast)**:\n- Normal text readability\n- Standard interface elements\n- Broad accessibility compliance\n\n**WCAG AAA Standard (7:1 contrast)**:\n- Large text and enhanced readability\n- Critical interface elements  \n- Maximum accessibility compliance\n\n### Contrast Matrix System\n\nFor each color scale (50-950), we pre-compute which combinations meet accessibility standards:\n\n```\nBlue Scale Accessibility:\n- blue-50 + blue-800 = 7.2:1 (AAA)\n- blue-100 + blue-700 = 4.6:1 (AA)  \n- blue-200 + blue-600 = 3.1:1 (Fails)\n```\n\nThis eliminates guesswork - designers know immediately which combinations are accessible, and AI agents can implement these validated choices.\n\n## Semantic Color Intelligence\n\n### Trust-Building Color Psychology\n\nColors communicate trustworthiness through cultural and psychological associations:\n\n**Blues (240°-260°)**:\n- Professional, reliable, systematic\n- Ideal for primary actions, navigation, business interfaces\n- Universal positive associations across cultures\n\n**Greens (120°-160°)**:\n- Success, growth, positive outcomes\n- Perfect for confirmation states, progress indicators\n- Associated with safety and \"go\" signals\n\n**Reds (0°-30°)**:\n- Urgency, importance, irreversible actions\n- Essential for destructive operations, critical warnings\n- Demands attention and careful consideration\n\n**Ambers/Oranges (30°-60°)**:\n- Caution, moderate warning, review needed\n- Balanced between urgency and calm\n- \"Proceed with awareness\" psychological signal\n\n### Cognitive Load Through Color\n\nColors carry mental processing weight:\n\n**Low Cognitive Load**:\n- Neutral grays and subtle backgrounds\n- Don't compete for attention\n- Support content without distraction\n\n**Medium Cognitive Load**:\n- Branded colors and interactive elements\n- Guide user attention systematically\n- Balance visibility with restraint\n\n**High Cognitive Load**:\n- Error states and critical warnings\n- Emergency actions and destructive operations\n- Command immediate attention and careful thought\n\n## Color Scale Mathematics\n\n### Perceptually Uniform Scales\n\nRafters generates 11-step color scales (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 950) where each step represents an equal perceptual change:\n\n**Lightness Progression**:\n- **50**: 95% lightness (subtle backgrounds)\n- **500**: 50% lightness (balanced middle)\n- **950**: 5% lightness (high contrast text)\n\n**Chroma Adjustments**:\n- Light colors (50-200): Lower chroma to prevent overwhelming brightness\n- Mid colors (300-700): Full chroma for vibrant interface elements\n- Dark colors (800-950): Adjusted chroma to maintain richness without muddiness\n\nThis mathematical approach ensures every color in a scale works harmoniously with every other color.\n\n## Atmospheric Perspective\n\n### Visual Depth Through Color\n\nBorrowed from classical art theory, warm colors advance and cool colors recede:\n\n**Foreground Elements** (Warm Colors):\n- Reds, oranges, warm yellows\n- Buttons, calls-to-action, important content\n- Draw attention and appear closer\n\n**Background Elements** (Cool Colors):  \n- Blues, blue-grays, cool greens\n- Page backgrounds, containers, subtle elements\n- Recede visually, create depth\n\n**Midground Elements** (Balanced):\n- Neutral grays, balanced purples\n- Content areas, secondary navigation\n- Neither advance nor recede\n\nThis creates natural visual hierarchy without relying on size or positioning alone.\n\n## Color Temperature Analysis\n\n### Systematic Warmth Classification\n\nRafters automatically analyzes color temperature:\n\n**Warm Colors (0°-60°, 300°-360°)**:\n- Energetic, friendly, approachable\n- Advance toward viewer\n- Ideal for engagement and action\n\n**Cool Colors (120°-240°)**:\n- Calm, professional, trustworthy  \n- Recede from viewer\n- Perfect for backgrounds and supporting elements\n\n**Neutral Colors (60°-120°, 240°-300°)**:\n- Balanced visual weight\n- Neither warm nor cool dominance\n- Versatile for any interface role\n\nThis analysis helps designers understand how color temperature affects user perception, and helps AI agents implement temperature-conscious color choices made by designers.\n\n## Design Decision Framework\n\n### For Designers\n\nWhen making color decisions, consider:\n\n1. **Purpose**: What should this color communicate?\n2. **Hierarchy**: Should this element advance or recede?\n3. **Accessibility**: What contrast ratio is required?\n4. **Harmony**: How does this relate to other colors in the interface?\n5. **Cognitive Load**: How much attention should this demand?\n\nUse mathematical color theory to:\n\n- Create systematic color palettes with proven harmony\n- Ensure accessibility compliance from the start\n- Build visual hierarchy through color weight\n- Communicate meaning through color psychology\n- Maintain consistency across design decisions\n\n### For AI Agents\n\nWhen implementing designer color decisions:\n\n- Understand the mathematical relationships between chosen colors\n- Respect the cognitive load and trust levels embedded in color choices\n- Apply accessibility intelligence to validate color combinations\n- Maintain harmony relationships established by designers\n- Implement temperature and atmospheric perspective correctly\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nColors in Rafters aren't decorative - they're functional design elements that:\n\n- **Guide user attention** through visual hierarchy\n- **Communicate meaning** through psychological associations  \n- **Ensure accessibility** through systematic contrast\n- **Create harmony** through mathematical relationships\n- **Support cognition** through predictable color behavior\n\nThis approach transforms color from arbitrary aesthetic choice into systematic design intelligence that both humans and AI agents can understand and apply consistently.","src/content/docs/foundation/color-system.mdx","94aa22fe031ddf0a","foundation/color-system.mdx","foundation/design-intelligence",{"id":65,"data":67,"body":71,"filePath":72,"digest":73,"legacyId":74,"deferredRender":21},{"title":68,"description":69,"order":70},"Design Intelligence","Understanding cognitive load, attention economics, and trust patterns in UI design",2,"# Design Intelligence Framework\n\nRafters embeds human design reasoning into every component through a systematic intelligence framework.

Every component includes cognitive load ratings, trust patterns, and systematic UX guidance for both human developers and AI agents.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nInitialize Rafters in your project:\n\n```bash\nnpx rafters init\n```\n\nAdd your first component:\n\n```bash\nnpx rafters add button\n```\n\nThat's it! You now have a mathematically-sound, AI-readable design system. Components work immediately with grayscale defaults.\n\n## What Makes Rafters Different\n\nUnlike traditional component libraries, Rafters captures **why** designers make decisions, not just what they chose:\n\n- **Cognitive Load Intelligence**: Every component rated 0-10 for mental effort\n- **Trust Building Patterns**: Systematic confidence patterns for different consequence levels\n- **Attention Economics**: Mathematical visual hierarchy and component priority\n- **Machine-Readable Standards**: AI agents can consume design reasoning directly\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Intelligence Over Aesthetics\nBeautiful components are table stakes. Rafters focuses on capturing the reasoning behind design decisions in formats that AI agents can understand and apply systematically.\n\n### 2. Mathematical Foundation\n- **OKLCH Color Space**: Perceptually uniform color relationships\n- **Golden Ratio Spacing**: Harmonious proportional systems\n- **Miller's Law**: Cognitive load management through systematic information chunking\n- **Progressive Enhancement**: Universal accessibility with enhanced experiences\n\n### 3. Semantic-First Design\nNever ask \"What color should this be?\" Always ask \"What should this color communicate?\"\n\nComponents use semantic tokens that carry meaning:\n- `bg-primary` = trust-building color for main actions\n- `text-destructive-foreground` = consequences clearly communicated\n- `space-md` = systematic spacing relationships\n\n## AI Agent Integration\n\nRafters is designed for AI consumption:\n\n```tsx\n// AI agents read component intelligence\nconst buttonIntelligence = {\n  cognitiveLoad: 3,\n  attentionEconomics: \"Primary variant commands highest attention\",\n  trustBuilding: \"Destructive actions require confirmation patterns\",\n  usagePatterns: {\n    dos: [\"Maximum 1 primary button per section\"],\n    nevers: [\"Multiple primary buttons competing for attention\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Explore Design Intelligence** → Learn how cognitive load, attention economics, and trust building inform component behavior\n2. **Browse Components** → Each component includes live previews and embedded reasoning\n3. **Apply Systematically** → Use embedded guidance for consistent design decisions\n4. **Integrate with AI** → Leverage machine-readable intelligence for automated design\n\n## Design System Structure\n\n```\n.rafters/\n├── config.json           # System configuration\n├── tokens/               # Design tokens with semantic meaning\n│   ├── colors.json       # OKLCH color relationships\n│   ├── spacing.json      # Golden ratio spacing system\n│   └── typography.json   # Hierarchical text patterns\n├── components/           # Component intelligence and code\n└── intelligence/         # AI-readable design reasoning\n```\n\nThe `.rafters/` directory contains your complete design system with embedded intelligence that Git tracks as part of your codebase.","src/content/docs/foundation/getting-started.mdx","23a24e63896a8d3f","foundation/getting-started.mdx","foundation/mcp-server",{"id":85,"data":87,"body":93,"filePath":94,"digest":95,"legacyId":96,"deferredRender":21},{"title":88,"description":89,"order":90,"cognitiveLoad":91,"draft":92},"MCP Server Foundation","Transform AI design capabilities with live design intelligence access",5,4,false,"import ComponentPreview from '../../../components/ComponentPreview.tsx'\n\n# MCP Server Foundation\n\n**Transform AI Design Capabilities with Live Design Intelligence**\n\nThe Rafters MCP server gives AI agents direct access to embedded design reasoning, enabling them to make informed UX decisions instead of guessing. Think of it as a design expert that AI can consult in real-time.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nInstead of AI agents making arbitrary design choices, they can now:\n\n- **Ask \"Why?\"** - Access the reasoning behind every design decision\n- **Validate Choices** - Check if color combinations meet accessibility standards\n- **Manage Complexity** - Calculate cognitive load before overwhelming users\n- **Build Trust** - Apply appropriate patterns for different consequence levels\n- **Stay Consistent** - Follow systematic design intelligence throughout\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-8\">\n  \u003Ch3 className=\"text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-3\">Current Status\u003C/h3>\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"flex items-center space-x-2\">\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"w-3 h-3 bg-green-500 rounded-full\">\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cspan className=\"text-blue-800 font-medium\">AVAILABLE -

System","Hierarchical text patterns with IBM Plex fonts and systematic scaling relationships","# Typography System\n\nRafters uses IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono to create a distinctive technical aesthetic that signals \"this is for builders\" while maintaining excellent readability for all content types.\n\n## Font Selection Strategy\n\n### IBM Plex Sans - Body Text\n**Purpose**: Optimized for extended reading and UI text\n- **Weight Range**: 100-700 (Light to Bold)\n- **Default Weight**: 300 (Light) for reduced visual weight\n- **Line Height**: 1.6-1.7 for comfortable reading\n- **Use Cases**: Paragraphs, descriptions, labels, form inputs\n\n### IBM Plex Mono - Headings & Code\n**Purpose**: Technical identity and code display\n- **Weight Range**: 100-700 (Light to Bold) \n- **Default Weight**: 400 (Regular) for proper mono spacing\n- **Line Height**: 1.2 for tight heading hierarchy\n- **Use Cases**: Headings, code blocks, technical labels\n\n## Hierarchical Scale\n\n### Heading Hierarchy\n```css\n/* H1 - Page Titles */\nh1 { \n  font-family: var(--font-mono);\n  font-size: 2.25rem;      /* 36px */\n  line-height: 1.2;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n/* H2 - Major Sections */\nh2 { \n  font-family: var(--font-mono);\n  font-size: 1.875rem;     /* 30px */\n  line-height: 1.2;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;\n  padding-bottom: 0.5rem;\n}\n\n/* H3 - Sub-sections */\nh3 { \n  font-family: var(--font-mono);\n  font-size: 1.5rem;       /* 24px */\n  line-height: 1.2;\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n\n/* H4-H6 - Minor headings */\nh4, h5, h6 { \n  font-family: var(--font-mono);\n  font-size: 1.25rem;      /* 20px */\n  line-height: 1.2;\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n```\n\n### Body Text Scale\n```css\n/* Large Text - Introductions */\n.text-xl {\n  font-family: var(--font-sans);\n  font-size: 1.25rem;      /* 20px */\n  line-height: 1.75;\n  font-weight: 300;\n}\n\n/* Standard Text - Default body */\n.text-lg {\n  font-family: var(--font-sans);\n  font-size: 1.125rem;     /* 18px */\n  line-height: 1.7;\n  font-weight: 300;\n}\n\n/* Base Text - UI elements */\n.text-base {\n  font-family: var(--font-sans);\n  font-size:

300;\n}\n```\n\n## Mathematical Relationships\n\n### Modular Scale\nTypography follows a **1.2 ratio (Minor Third)** for harmonious proportional relationships:\n\n- **12px** (0.75rem) - Captions\n- **14px** (0.875rem) - Secondary text  \n- **16px** (1rem) - Base size\n- **18px** (1.125rem) - Body text\n- **20px** (1.25rem) - Large body\n- **24px** (1.5rem) - H3\n- **30px** (1.875rem) - H2\n- **36px** (2.25rem) - H1\n\n### Line Height Strategy\n- **Headings**: 1.2 (tight for visual hierarchy)\n- **Body Text**: 1.6-1.7 (comfortable reading)\n- **UI Elements**: 1.25-1.5 (compact interfaces)\n- **Code**: 1.4 (readable but compact)\n\n## Semantic Typography Classes\n\n### Content-Aware Typography\n```css\n/* Article Typography - Automatic styling */\narticle h1, article h2, article h3 {\n  font-family: var(--font-mono);\n  margin-top: 2rem;\n  margin-bottom: 1rem;\n}\n\narticle p {\n  font-family: var(--font-sans);\n  font-weight: 300;\n  line-height: 1.7;\n

Cognitive Load** (0-2/10):\n- Light font weights (300)\n- Generous line spacing (1.6-1.7)\n- Comfortable font sizes (16px+)\n- High contrast ratios\n\n**Medium Cognitive Load** (3-5/10):\n- Regular font weights (400-500)\n- Standard line spacing (1.4-1.6)\n- Smaller font sizes (14-16px)\n- Clear hierarchy\n\n**High Cognitive Load** (6+/10):\n- Bold font weights (600-700)\n- Tight line spacing (1.2-1.4)\n- Dense information display\n- Multiple font sizes in proximity\n\n### Trust Building Through Typography\n- **Professional**: IBM Plex Mono for headings signals technical expertise\n- **Readable**: IBM Plex Sans ensures accessibility and comfort\n- **Systematic**: Mathematical scale demonstrates design precision\n- **Consistent**: Same fonts across all brand touchpoints\n\nThis typography system supports both human readers and AI agents by providing clear semantic meaning, systematic relationships, and embedded reasoning about cognitive load and trust

'../../../components/ComponentPreview.tsx'\n\n# Container Component\n\nThe Container component is an invisible structural element that controls content width and breathing room without competing for attention. It provides semantic HTML structure with intelligent defaults based on element type.\n\n## Design Intelligence\n\n\u003CComponentPreview \n  component=\"container\" \n  showIntelligence={true}\n  height=\"180px\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n**Cognitive Load: 0/10** - Invisible structure that reduces visual complexity rather than adding to it.\n\n**Trust Building:** Predictable boundaries and consistent spacing patterns create user confidence through systematic layout behavior.\n\n**Semantic Meaning:** Content width control with contextual intelligence:\n- `as=\"main\"` → Primary content container\n- `as=\"section\"` → Thematic content grouping  \n- `as=\"article\"` → Standalone reading content\n\n## Usage Patterns\n\n### ✅ DO\n- Use padding prop for internal breathing room\n- Control content boundaries with semantic max-width\n- Apply semantic structure with `as=\"main|section|article\"`\n- Maintain predictable component boundaries\n\n### ❌ NEVER\n- Use margins for content spacing (use padding instead)\n- Unnecessarily nest containers or use fixed widths\n\n## Basic Examples\n\n### Main Content Container\n\u003CComponentPreview \n  component=\"container\" \n  variant=\"main\"\n  props='{\"as\": \"main\", \"padding\": \"8\"}'\n  height=\"120px\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n```tsx\n\u003CContainer as=\"main\" padding=\"8\">\n  Main page content with comfortable breathing

Thematic content grouping with moderate width\n\u003C/Container>\n```\n\n## Semantic Intelligence\n\nThe Container component automatically applies intelligent defaults based on the semantic HTML element:\n\n| Element | Default Size | Default Padding | Special Features | Use Case |\n|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|\n| `main` | `full` | `8` | Container queries enabled | Primary content, takes full width |\n| `article` | `4xl` | `6` | **Automatic theme typography** | Optimal reading width (~65 characters) |\n| `section` | `5xl` | `4` | Container queries enabled | Thematic grouping, moderate width |\n| `div` | `4xl` | `4` | Basic container | Generic container |\n\n## Automatic Article Styling\n\nWhen using `as=\"article\"`, the Container renders as an HTML `\u003Carticle>` element, which automatically receives typography styling from the theme's article tag styles:\n\n- **Typography Hierarchy:** Optimized heading sizes, line-heights, and spacing\n- **Reading Flow:** Proper paragraph spacing and text flow patterns  \n- **Accessibility:** Enhanced contrast and readable font sizing\n- **Design System Integration:** Consistent with typography tokens\n\n```tsx\n\u003CContainer as=\"article\">\n  {/* Automatic article typography from theme */}\n  \u003Ch1>Main Heading\u003C/h1>      {/* Styled by article h1 rules */}\n  \u003Cp>Body paragraph...\u003C/p>    {/* Styled by article p rules */}\n  \u003Ch2>Section Heading\u003C/h2>    {/* Styled by article h2 rules */}\n  \u003Cblockquote>Quote\u003C/blockquote> {/* Styled by article blockquote rules */}\n\u003C/Container>\n```\n\nThis semantic approach enables the Container to understand content type and apply appropriate styling automatically through native HTML semantics, reducing the need for additional CSS classes.\n\n## Size Variants\n\nControl content width using standard Tailwind max-width utilities:\n\n| Size | Max Width | Use Case |\n|------|-----------|----------|\n| `sm` | 24rem | Compact cards, narrow content |\n| `md` | 28rem | Form containers, small content |\n| `lg` | 32rem | Medium content blocks |\n| `xl` | 36rem | Standard content width |\n| `2xl` | 42rem | Comfortable reading |\n| `3xl` | 48rem | Rich content layouts |\n| `4xl` | 56rem | Default container width |\n| `5xl` | 64rem | Wide content layouts |\n| `6xl` | 72rem | Dashboard layouts |\n| `7xl` | 80rem | Ultra-wide content |\n| `full` | 100% | Full viewport width |\n\n## Accessibility Features\n\n- **Semantic HTML:** Proper landmark roles (`main`, `section`, `article`)\n- **Screen Reader Support:** Meaningful structure for assistive technology\n- **Predictable Navigation:** Consistent layout patterns aid orientation\n\n## Design System Integration\n\n- **Spacing Tokens:** Uses `--spacing-*` design system tokens\n- **Semantic Structure:** Integrates with typography and layout intelligence\n- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JavaScript, enhanced with design tokens\n\n## Related Components\n\n- **Grid:** For multi-column layout within containers\n- **Typography:** For text hierarchy within container boundaries\n- **Layout Primitives:** Building systematic page structures\n\nThe Container component serves as the foundation for systematic layout design, providing invisible structure that enhances rather than competes

dismissed\n- **Escape Key:** Always available escape hatch\n- **Backdrop Dismissal:** Click outside to close (non-destructive actions)\n- **Screen Reader Support:** Proper ARIA attributes and announcements\n- **Keyboard Navigation:** Tab order and focus management\n\n## Trust-Building Visual Patterns\n\nThe Dialog component includes visual cues that build user confidence:\n\n| Trust Level | Visual Indicators |\n|-------------|------------------|\n| **Low** | Standard borders, minimal visual weight |\n| **Medium** | Subtle primary border hints |\n| **High** | Enhanced borders, increased shadow |\n| **Critical** | Strong border emphasis, enhanced shadows |\n| **Destructive** | Warning-colored borders and shadows |\n\n## Cognitive Complexity Management\n\nDialog spacing and layout adapt to content complexity:\n\n| Complexity | Padding | Gap | Use Case |\n|------------|---------|-----|----------|\n| **Simple** | 16px | 12px | Yes/No confirmations |\n| **Moderate** | 24px | 16px | Forms with explanation |\n| **Complex** | 32px | 24px | Multi-step processes |\n\n## Animation and Motion\n\nDialogs use trust-building animation patterns:\n- **Smooth entrance:** Reduces cognitive jarring with fade-in and gentle zoom\n- **Backdrop blur:** Creates focus without harsh visual breaks\n- **Consistent timing:** Predictable animation duration builds confidence\n\n## Error Handling\n\nFor critical dialogs, implement progressive confirmation:\n\n```tsx\n\u003CDialogContent trustLevel=\"critical\" destructive>\n  \u003CDialogTitle>Delete Account\u003C/DialogTitle>\n  \u003CDialogDescription>\n    Type \"DELETE\" to confirm account deletion.\n  \u003C/DialogDescription>\n  \u003CInput \n    placeholder=\"Type DELETE to confirm\"\n    onChange={(e) => setConfirmation(e.target.value)}\n  />\n  \u003CDialogFooter>\n    \u003CButton \n      variant=\"destructive\" \n      disabled={confirmation !== \"DELETE\"}\n    >\n      Delete Account\n    \u003C/Button>\n  \u003C/DialogFooter>\n\u003C/DialogContent>\n```\n\n## Design System Integration\n\n- **Motion Tokens:** Uses design system motion tokens for consistent animations\n- **Trust Patterns:** Visual hierarchy based on consequence levels\n- **Focus Management:** Radix UI primitives ensure accessibility\n- **Escape Hatches:** Multiple ways to dismiss (ESC, backdrop, close button)\n\nThe Dialog component balances user agency with necessary interruption, providing clear escape hatches while ensuring important decisions receive appropriate attention and consideration.","src/content/docs/components/dialog.mdx","c02113720b919430","components/dialog.mdx","components/example",{"id":184,"data":186,"body":190,"filePath":191,"digest":192,"legacyId":193,"deferredRender":21},{"title":187,"description":188,"cognitiveLoad":60,"order":189,"draft":21},"Component
