# Welcome to Rafters Documentation

This is our new **MDX-powered** documentation system for Rafters design intelligence, using our own Container component for proper layout.

## Why MDX?

<Grid preset="linear" gap="comfortable">
  <GridItem>
    **Better control** over styling and layout with design system integration
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem>
    **Direct integration** with our React components and design tokens
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem>
    **Seamless development** experience with hot reloading and TypeScript
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem>
    **Better performance** than Storybook for documentation publishing
  </GridItem>
</Grid>

## Component Example

Here's how we can embed Rafters components directly in our docs using our Grid system:

<Grid preset="golden" gap="md">
  <GridItem priority="primary">
    **Primary content** gets the most visual weight and spans more space in our golden ratio grid layout.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem priority="secondary">
    **Secondary content** supports the main narrative with appropriate visual hierarchy.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem priority="tertiary">
    **Tertiary content** provides contextual information without competing for attention.
  </GridItem>
</Grid>

## Design Intelligence Integration

With MDX and Rafters components, we can create rich documentation that includes:

- Interactive component examples with embedded design intelligence
- Live code editing with proper semantic tokens
- Design reasoning explanations using our cognitive load principles
- Accessibility guidelines built into every component
- Usage patterns that follow attention economics

> This blockquote is styled with our design system tokens for consistent visual hierarchy.

### Bento Grid Example

<Grid preset="bento" bentoPattern="editorial" gap="comfortable">
  <GridItem priority="primary">
    **Hero Documentation Section** - This gets the most visual prominence in our bento layout, perfect for highlighting key concepts or major features.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem priority="secondary">
    **Supporting Information** - Secondary content that provides context without overwhelming the primary message.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem priority="secondary">
    **Additional Context** - More supporting details that complement the main narrative.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem priority="tertiary">
    **Tertiary Details** - Minor information that's available but doesn't distract from the main content flow.
  </GridItem>
</Grid>

Let's build systematic, intelligent design documentation! ⚡
