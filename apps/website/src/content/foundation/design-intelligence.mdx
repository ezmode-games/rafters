# Design Intelligence Framework

Rafters embeds human design reasoning into every component through a systematic intelligence framework. This enables AI agents to make informed UX decisions rather than guessing at appropriate patterns.

## Cognitive Load Management

Every component receives a cognitive load rating from 0-10 based on the mental effort required to process and interact with it.

### The Scale

- **0-2: Invisible or Effortless**
  - Container (0/10): Invisible structure
  - Badge (1/10): Passive status indicators
  - Basic typography (2/10): Scannable text

- **3-5: Moderate Attention**
  - Button (3/10): Simple action triggers
  - Input (4/10): Basic data entry
  - Grid (4/10): Layout organization

- **6-8: Significant Investment**
  - Dialog (6/10): Modal interactions that interrupt flow
  - Complex forms (7/10): Multi-step data entry
  - Data tables (8/10): Dense information processing

- **9-10: Maximum Effort**
  - Critical decisions (9/10): Account deletion, financial transactions
  - Complex dashboards (10/10): Dense data visualization

### Application Rules

1. **Total Load Budget**: Aim for max 15-20 points per screen
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start low, reveal complexity incrementally
3. **Context Awareness**: Critical tasks can justify higher cognitive load
4. **Recovery Patterns**: High-load interactions need clear escape hatches

## Attention Economics

Components understand their role in the visual hierarchy and attention distribution.

### Attention Patterns

**Democratic Attention**: Equal visual weight across elements
- Linear grids
- Navigation lists
- Status indicators

**Hierarchical Attention**: Clear primary/secondary relationships
- Golden ratio layouts
- Typography scales
- Call-to-action patterns

**Focused Attention**: Single point of concentration
- Modal dialogs
- Alert notifications
- Primary actions

**Complex Attention**: Multiple attention points requiring careful management
- Bento box layouts
- Dashboard interfaces
- Multi-column content

### Mathematical Foundation

Attention distribution follows mathematical principles:
- **Golden Ratio (1.618)**: Natural visual hierarchy
- **Rule of Thirds**: Compositional balance
- **Fibonacci Sequences**: Harmonic spacing relationships

## Trust Building Patterns

Components adapt behavior based on consequence levels and user confidence requirements.

### Trust Levels

**Low Trust**: Minimal friction, easy reversal
- Social interactions (likes, follows)
- Preference settings
- Temporary actions

**Medium Trust**: Clear context, moderate confirmation
- Content publishing
- Profile updates
- Non-critical data changes

**High Trust**: Detailed explanation, enhanced visual weight
- Financial transactions
- Privacy settings
- Account modifications

**Critical Trust**: Progressive confirmation, multiple escape hatches
- Account deletion
- Permanent data loss
- Irreversible actions

### Trust Indicators

1. **Visual Weight**: Higher consequences = more prominent styling
2. **Confirmation Patterns**: Progressive confirmation for critical actions
3. **Escape Mechanisms**: Clear cancellation and undo pathways
4. **Context Clarity**: Explicit consequence communication

## Systematic Application

### Component Intelligence Integration

```tsx
/**
 * @cognitive-load 6 - Modal interaction interrupts user flow
 * @attention-economics Focused attention pattern with backdrop
 * @trust-building Adapts confirmation patterns to consequence level
 * @usage-patterns Never stack modals, always provide escape hatches
 */
function Dialog({ trustLevel = 'medium', children }) {
  // Intelligence-driven behavior adaptation
  const confirmationRequired = trustLevel === 'high' || trustLevel === 'critical';
  const visualWeight = getTrustWeight(trustLevel);
  
  return (
    <DialogPrimitive
      className={cn(visualWeight)}
      onEscapeKeyDown={allowEscape}
    >
      {children}
      {confirmationRequired && <ProgressiveConfirmation />}
    </DialogPrimitive>
  );
}
```

### Design Decision Framework

Before implementing any interface:

1. **Attention**: What deserves user focus?
2. **Cognition**: How much mental effort is required?
3. **Trust**: What's the consequence level?
4. **Recovery**: How can users correct mistakes?

### AI Agent Consumption

The intelligence framework enables AI agents to:
- Choose appropriate components for specific contexts
- Apply systematic visual hierarchy
- Respect cognitive load limitations
- Build user trust through appropriate patterns

This systematic approach ensures consistent, thoughtful user experiences whether designed by humans or AI agents.
