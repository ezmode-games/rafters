# Color System

**Mathematical color theory with embedded design reasoning for systematic color decisions.**

## Design Philosophy

Rafters uses mathematical color theory to create systematic color relationships that support human cognition and accessibility. Every color choice is based on measurable principles rather than arbitrary aesthetic decisions.

## OKLCH Color Space

### Why OKLCH Over RGB/HSL?

**OKLCH is perceptually uniform** - equal numeric changes produce equal visual changes across all colors:

- **L=50 always looks like 50% brightness** regardless of hue (red, blue, green all appear equally bright)
- **C=0.15 produces identical saturation levels** across all hues  
- **Hue rotation maintains consistent lightness** (no brightness shifts when changing colors)

This predictability helps designers and AI agents understand the systematic relationships between colors.

### Visual Consistency Example

```css
/* These three colors have identical visual brightness and saturation */
oklch(60% 0.15 0)    /* Red */
oklch(60% 0.15 120)  /* Green */  
oklch(60% 0.15 240)  /* Blue */
```

In RGB, achieving this visual consistency would require different values for each hue due to perceptual differences in how humans see red vs blue vs green.

## Mathematical Color Relationships

### Color Harmony Theory

Rafters generates harmonious color palettes using mathematical relationships:

**Complementary** (180° apart):
- Creates maximum contrast without visual clash
- Ideal for primary/accent color pairings
- Example: Blue (240°) + Orange (60°)

**Triadic** (120° apart):
- Three colors with balanced visual weight
- Provides variety while maintaining harmony
- Example: Red (0°) + Green (120°) + Blue (240°)

**Analogous** (30° apart):
- Creates subtle, sophisticated color progressions
- Perfect for gradient backgrounds and subtle variations
- Example: Blue (240°) → Blue-Purple (270°) → Purple (300°)

### Perceptual Color Weights

Different hues have different visual weights even at identical lightness and chroma:

1. **Red** - Heaviest visual weight, advances toward viewer
2. **Orange** - Warm, energetic, attention-grabbing
3. **Yellow** - Bright, optimistic, expands visually
4. **Green** - Balanced, natural, restful to eyes
5. **Blue** - Cool, recedes, trustworthy
6. **Purple** - Lightest weight, sophisticated

Designers can use these weights to create proper visual hierarchy - heavy colors for important elements, light colors for backgrounds. AI agents can understand and respect these hierarchies when implementing designs.

## Accessibility Through Mathematics

### Systematic Contrast Ratios

Instead of guessing which colors work together, Rafters pre-calculates all valid combinations:

**WCAG AA Standard (4.5:1 contrast)**:
- Normal text readability
- Standard interface elements
- Broad accessibility compliance

**WCAG AAA Standard (7:1 contrast)**:
- Large text and enhanced readability
- Critical interface elements  
- Maximum accessibility compliance

### Contrast Matrix System

For each color scale (50-950), we pre-compute which combinations meet accessibility standards:

```
Blue Scale Accessibility:
- blue-50 + blue-800 = 7.2:1 (AAA)
- blue-100 + blue-700 = 4.6:1 (AA)  
- blue-200 + blue-600 = 3.1:1 (Fails)
```

This eliminates guesswork - designers know immediately which combinations are accessible, and AI agents can implement these validated choices.

## Semantic Color Intelligence

### Trust-Building Color Psychology

Colors communicate trustworthiness through cultural and psychological associations:

**Blues (240°-260°)**:
- Professional, reliable, systematic
- Ideal for primary actions, navigation, business interfaces
- Universal positive associations across cultures

**Greens (120°-160°)**:
- Success, growth, positive outcomes
- Perfect for confirmation states, progress indicators
- Associated with safety and "go" signals

**Reds (0°-30°)**:
- Urgency, importance, irreversible actions
- Essential for destructive operations, critical warnings
- Demands attention and careful consideration

**Ambers/Oranges (30°-60°)**:
- Caution, moderate warning, review needed
- Balanced between urgency and calm
- "Proceed with awareness" psychological signal

### Cognitive Load Through Color

Colors carry mental processing weight:

**Low Cognitive Load**:
- Neutral grays and subtle backgrounds
- Don't compete for attention
- Support content without distraction

**Medium Cognitive Load**:
- Branded colors and interactive elements
- Guide user attention systematically
- Balance visibility with restraint

**High Cognitive Load**:
- Error states and critical warnings
- Emergency actions and destructive operations
- Command immediate attention and careful thought

## Color Scale Mathematics

### Perceptually Uniform Scales

Rafters generates 11-step color scales (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 950) where each step represents an equal perceptual change:

**Lightness Progression**:
- **50**: 95% lightness (subtle backgrounds)
- **500**: 50% lightness (balanced middle)
- **950**: 5% lightness (high contrast text)

**Chroma Adjustments**:
- Light colors (50-200): Lower chroma to prevent overwhelming brightness
- Mid colors (300-700): Full chroma for vibrant interface elements
- Dark colors (800-950): Adjusted chroma to maintain richness without muddiness

This mathematical approach ensures every color in a scale works harmoniously with every other color.

## Atmospheric Perspective

### Visual Depth Through Color

Borrowed from classical art theory, warm colors advance and cool colors recede:

**Foreground Elements** (Warm Colors):
- Reds, oranges, warm yellows
- Buttons, calls-to-action, important content
- Draw attention and appear closer

**Background Elements** (Cool Colors):  
- Blues, blue-grays, cool greens
- Page backgrounds, containers, subtle elements
- Recede visually, create depth

**Midground Elements** (Balanced):
- Neutral grays, balanced purples
- Content areas, secondary navigation
- Neither advance nor recede

This creates natural visual hierarchy without relying on size or positioning alone.

## Color Temperature Analysis

### Systematic Warmth Classification

Rafters automatically analyzes color temperature:

**Warm Colors (0°-60°, 300°-360°)**:
- Energetic, friendly, approachable
- Advance toward viewer
- Ideal for engagement and action

**Cool Colors (120°-240°)**:
- Calm, professional, trustworthy  
- Recede from viewer
- Perfect for backgrounds and supporting elements

**Neutral Colors (60°-120°, 240°-300°)**:
- Balanced visual weight
- Neither warm nor cool dominance
- Versatile for any interface role

This analysis helps designers understand how color temperature affects user perception, and helps AI agents implement temperature-conscious color choices made by designers.

## Design Decision Framework

### For Designers

When making color decisions, consider:

1. **Purpose**: What should this color communicate?
2. **Hierarchy**: Should this element advance or recede?
3. **Accessibility**: What contrast ratio is required?
4. **Harmony**: How does this relate to other colors in the interface?
5. **Cognitive Load**: How much attention should this demand?

Use mathematical color theory to:

- Create systematic color palettes with proven harmony
- Ensure accessibility compliance from the start
- Build visual hierarchy through color weight
- Communicate meaning through color psychology
- Maintain consistency across design decisions

### For AI Agents

When implementing designer color decisions:

- Understand the mathematical relationships between chosen colors
- Respect the cognitive load and trust levels embedded in color choices
- Apply accessibility intelligence to validate color combinations
- Maintain harmony relationships established by designers
- Implement temperature and atmospheric perspective correctly

## Implementation Philosophy

Colors in Rafters aren't decorative - they're functional design elements that:

- **Guide user attention** through visual hierarchy
- **Communicate meaning** through psychological associations  
- **Ensure accessibility** through systematic contrast
- **Create harmony** through mathematical relationships
- **Support cognition** through predictable color behavior

This approach transforms color from arbitrary aesthetic choice into systematic design intelligence that both humans and AI agents can understand and apply consistently.
