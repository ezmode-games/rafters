# Getting Started with Rafters

Rafters is an AI-first design system that embeds human design reasoning into machine-readable formats. Every component includes cognitive load ratings, trust patterns, and systematic UX guidance for both human developers and AI agents.

## Quick Start

Initialize Rafters in your project:

```bash
npx rafters init
```

Add your first component:

```bash
npx rafters add button
```

That's it! You now have a mathematically-sound, AI-readable design system. Components work immediately with grayscale defaults.

## What Makes Rafters Different

Unlike traditional component libraries, Rafters captures **why** designers make decisions, not just what they chose:

- **Cognitive Load Intelligence**: Every component rated 0-10 for mental effort
- **Trust Building Patterns**: Systematic confidence patterns for different consequence levels
- **Attention Economics**: Mathematical visual hierarchy and component priority
- **Machine-Readable Standards**: AI agents can consume design reasoning directly

## Core Principles

### 1. Intelligence Over Aesthetics
Beautiful components are table stakes. Rafters focuses on capturing the reasoning behind design decisions in formats that AI agents can understand and apply systematically.

### 2. Mathematical Foundation
- **OKLCH Color Space**: Perceptually uniform color relationships
- **Golden Ratio Spacing**: Harmonious proportional systems
- **Miller's Law**: Cognitive load management through systematic information chunking
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Universal accessibility with enhanced experiences

### 3. Semantic-First Design
Never ask "What color should this be?" Always ask "What should this color communicate?"

Components use semantic tokens that carry meaning:
- `bg-primary` = trust-building color for main actions
- `text-destructive-foreground` = consequences clearly communicated
- `space-md` = systematic spacing relationships

## AI Agent Integration

Rafters is designed for AI consumption:

```tsx
// AI agents read component intelligence
const buttonIntelligence = {
  cognitiveLoad: 3,
  attentionEconomics: "Primary variant commands highest attention",
  trustBuilding: "Destructive actions require confirmation patterns",
  usagePatterns: {
    dos: ["Maximum 1 primary button per section"],
    nevers: ["Multiple primary buttons competing for attention"]
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Explore Design Intelligence** → Learn how cognitive load, attention economics, and trust building inform component behavior
2. **Browse Components** → Each component includes live previews and embedded reasoning
3. **Apply Systematically** → Use embedded guidance for consistent design decisions
4. **Integrate with AI** → Leverage machine-readable intelligence for automated design
