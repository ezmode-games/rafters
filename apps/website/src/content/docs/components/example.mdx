# Component Preview Example

This page demonstrates how components can be previewed with isolated Shadow DOM rendering and design intelligence.

## Button Component

The button component has a cognitive load of 3/10 and includes attention economics guidance.

<ComponentPreview 
  component="button" 
  variant="primary" 
  props='{"children": "Primary Action"}' 
  showIntelligence={true}
  height="150px"
  client:load
/>

## Different Button Variants

<ComponentPreview 
  component="button" 
  variant="secondary" 
  props='{"children": "Secondary Action"}' 
  showIntelligence={false}
  height="120px"
  client:load
/>

## Container Component

The container component has a cognitive load of 0/10 as it's a neutral structural element.

<ComponentPreview 
  component="container" 
  showIntelligence={true}
  height="200px"
  client:load
/>

## Error Handling

Here's what happens when a component doesn't exist:

<ComponentPreview 
  component="non-existent" 
  height="150px"
  client:load
/>

## Design Intelligence

When `showIntelligence` is enabled, you can see the embedded design reasoning that helps AI agents make informed UX decisions:

- **Cognitive Load**: Mental effort rating (0-10 scale)
- **Attention Economics**: Visual hierarchy and usage rules  
- **Trust Building**: Confidence patterns for different consequence levels

This system enables 100% portable component documentation with real component previews.
