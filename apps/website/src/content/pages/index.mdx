Designers pick a color. We handle the math. AI agents build interfaces that actually work.

No more guessing what button variant to use. No more wondering if colors have enough contrast. No more AI-generated UIs that look like garbage.

Rafters captures why designers make decisions, not just what they chose. When you override our mathematical color scale because "the blue needs more pop," we remember that. When AI builds the next interface, it knows your brand needs that extra saturation.

Start with grayscale. Add your taste. Ship accessible interfaces. It's that simple.

## Get Started

Initialize Rafters in your project:

```bash
npx rafters init
```
Add your first component:

```bash
npx rafters add button
```

That's it. You now have a mathematically-sound, AI-readable design system. Components work immediately with grayscale defaults. Run Studio later to add your brand personality.


## But shadcn/ui! 
You might be thinking, "Wait, shadcn/ui already does this!" And you're right. Sort of.

**shadcn/ui isn't a design system. It's a component library. Big difference.**

shadcn gives you beautiful, accessible React components. You still need to figure out your colors, your spacing scale, your typography ratios, when to use what variant, and why. Every team using shadcn makes different decisions. That's fine if you have a designer. It's chaos when AI is building your interfaces.

Rafters is an actual design system built for AI agents. Mathematical design rules (golden ratios, OKLCH color science, Miller's Law) get serialized into JSON. Your designer's choices get captured as structured data. Best practices become machine-readable standards. Components ship with a registry that tells agents exactly when to use what, why, and how.

This isn't documentation for humans to read. It's a structured knowledge base that AI agents consume. Every design decision - from your brand's specific blue to why buttons need 44px touch targets - lives in a format that machines understand and Git tracks. Your AI doesn't guess what button to use; it reads the registry and knows.
