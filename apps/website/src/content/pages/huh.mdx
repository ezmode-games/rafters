You're probably wondering why another design system exists. Here's the real story.

### The Problem: AI Has No Taste

We tried everything to teach AI good design. Built scrapers that collected the top 15,000 websites and their CSS. Fed massive vector databases full of design examples to AI models. Documented every design principle we could think of. Prompts that explained color theory, typography, layout, and accessibility.

AI agents didn't care. The agent would rush in, pattern match on surface-level similarities, and generate interfaces that looked technically correct but felt completely wrong. Bad spacing. Poor hierarchy. Accessibility violations. No sense of rhythm or proportion.

By the time anyone realized the AI had made a mess, it was too late. The damage was done. Hours or days wasted. WCAG or Section 508? Forget it.

Traditional design systems provide components without reasoning. AI agents cannot distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate usage contexts. Basic UI component systems? Forget it. They just make things worse by giving AI more options to choose from without any guidance.

### Insight: Stop Trying to Teach Taste, Embed It

We realized we were solving the wrong problem. Instead of trying to teach AI aesthetic judgment (which may never work), we decided to embed human design intelligence directly into the system itself.

Rafters embeds human design reasoning directly into component metadata. Each component includes:

- **Cognitive load ratings** (0-10 scale): Mental effort required from users
- **Trust level indicators**: Critical, high, medium, low reliability requirements
- **Accessibility compliance**: WCAG AA/AAA validation with contrast ratios
- **Usage context rules**: When to apply each component variant
- **Mathematical relationships**: Spacing scales, typography ratios, color harmonies

### Implementation Strategy

**Default safety**: Mathematical spacing systems and semantic color tokens prevent basic layout failures. Container and grid components handle structural requirements automatically.

**Intelligence on demand**: When implementation decisions require human judgment, query component metadata for cognitive load impacts, trust requirements, and usage patterns. No guessing required.

**Validation rules**: Built-in constraints prevent accessibility violations and maintain visual hierarchy.

**MCP Server**: When the AI agent is unsure, it can query the MCP server for recommendations based on embedded design intelligence and the deep token context of the current project.

### Operational Benefits

AI agents implement functional interfaces without design expertise, then access embedded intelligence for optimization decisions. System prevents common failure modes while preserving access to human design reasoning.

Quality degrades gracefully. Even minimal implementations maintain baseline usability standards.

Humans apply taste and brand via the Studio to create intent. Studio records the reasoning behind every design decision, which is then embedded into the component and token registry for AI consumption.

### Why "Rafters"?

Rafters provide structural support in structures;essential infrastructure that enables everything built above. Similarly, this design system provides foundational intelligence that supports interface generation without requiring explicit design knowledge.

<FAQSection

>
  <FAQ question="Wait, what's Rafters again?">
    It's a design system built for AI agents. Instead of just giving you components, we capture the design reasoning behind every decision and make it machine-readable.

    When AI builds interfaces using Rafters, it doesn't guess; it reads the embedded intelligence about cognitive load, attention economics, and trust patterns.
  </FAQ>

  <FAQ question="How is this different from shadcn/ui?">
    shadcn/ui is a collection of copy-paste components. Rafters is a design system—a comprehensive set of standards, components, patterns, and guidelines that work together as a cohesive system.

    Design systems provide the "why" behind design decisions, not just the "what." Rafters takes this further by encoding design reasoning into machine-readable metadata that AI agents can understand and apply systematically.

    Every component includes cognitive load ratings, attention economics patterns, and trust-building requirements. This embedded intelligence helps maintain design consistency and user experience quality at scale.
  </FAQ>

  <FAQ question="What's with the cognitive load ratings?">
    Every component gets a rating from 0-10 based on how much mental effort it requires. A Container is 0/10 (invisible structure), a Button is 3/10 (simple action), a Dialog is 6/10 (interrupts flow).

    AI agents can use these ratings to build interfaces that respect users' cognitive capacity and avoid overwhelming them.
  </FAQ>

  <FAQ question="Can I use this without AI?">
    Absolutely! The components work perfectly for human developers too. The embedded intelligence just makes the design decisions more explicit and systematic.

    Think of it as documentation that never gets out of sync because it's built into the components themselves.
  </FAQ>

  <FAQ question="What's in the registry?">
    Component code, design intelligence metadata, usage patterns, accessibility requirements, and examples. Everything an AI agent needs to understand how to use components appropriately.

## Still confused?

That's fair. We're trying to solve a problem most people don't even know exists yet. AI-generated interfaces are about to flood the world, and most of them are going to be terrible.

#### Rafters is our attempt to fix that before it becomes everyone's problem.
