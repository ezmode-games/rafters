				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Wait, what's Rafters again?</h2>
				<p class="mb-6">
					It's a design system built for AI agents. Instead of just giving you components, 
					we capture the design reasoning behind every decision and make it machine-readable.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-6">
					When AI builds interfaces using Rafters, it doesn't guess - it reads the embedded 
					intelligence about cognitive load, attention economics, and trust patterns.

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">How is this different from shadcn/ui?</h2>
				<p class="mb-6">
					shadcn/ui gives you beautiful components. Rafters gives you beautiful components 
					<em>plus</em> the intelligence about when and why to use them.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-6">
					Every Rafters component includes metadata like cognitive load ratings, attention 
					economics patterns, and trust-building requirements. AI agents can read this data 
					and make informed UX decisions.

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Why IBM Plex fonts?</h2>
				<p class="mb-6">
					IBM Plex was designed for technical interfaces. The mono variant gives headings 
					a distinctive technical aesthetic that signals "this is for builders," while the 
					sans variant provides excellent readability for body text.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-6">
					Plus, it's free, well-made, and has excellent support for code and data display.
				</p>

			<section class="mb-12">
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">What's with the cognitive load ratings?</h2>
				<p class="mb-6">
					Every component gets a rating from 0-10 based on how much mental effort it requires. 
					A Container is 0/10 (invisible structure), a Button is 3/10 (simple action), 
					a Dialog is 6/10 (interrupts flow).
				</p>
				<p class="mb-6">
					AI agents can use these ratings to build interfaces that respect users' cognitive 
					capacity and avoid overwhelming them.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="mb-12">
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Can I use this without AI?</h2>
				<p class="mb-6">
					Absolutely! The components work perfectly for human developers too. The embedded 
					intelligence just makes the design decisions more explicit and systematic.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-6">
					Think of it as documentation that never gets out of sync because it's built into 
					the components themselves.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="mb-12">
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">What's in the registry?</h2>
				<p class="mb-6">
					Component code, design intelligence metadata, usage patterns, accessibility 
					requirements, and examples. Everything an AI agent needs to understand how 
					to use components appropriately.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-6">
					Check out <a href="/llms.txt" class="underline">llms.txt</a> for the AI-focused 
					documentation, or browse the <a href="/docs/components" class="underline">component docs</a> 
					for human-readable explanations.
