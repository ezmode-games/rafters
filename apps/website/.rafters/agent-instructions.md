# Rafters AI Agent Instructions

This project uses Rafters design system components with embedded intelligence.

## Component Usage Guidelines
- Always read component intelligence before using components
- Use semantic tokens instead of arbitrary values  
- Follow trust-building patterns for user actions
- Apply accessibility standards systematically

## Key Principles
- **Cognitive Load**: Choose components appropriate for user mental capacity
- **Trust Building**: Follow patterns that build user confidence
- **Attention Economics**: Understand visual hierarchy and component priority
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build from core experience outward
- **Negative Space**: Use whitespace to create hierarchy and breathing room
- **Typography Intelligence**: Apply systematic text hierarchy for scannable content

## Design Intelligence Framework

Before implementing any interface, apply this framework:

1. **Attention**: What deserves user focus? → Manage finite cognitive resources
2. **Cognition**: How much mental effort? → Apply Miller's Law, prevent overwhelm  
3. **Space**: How does whitespace create hierarchy? → Master negative space
4. **Typography**: How does text support information flow? → Create information architecture
5. **Enhancement**: What's core vs. enhanced? → Build from core experience outward
6. **Trust**: What's the consequence level? → Build confidence through appropriate friction

## Component Intelligence Integration

Every component includes design reasoning:

```tsx
/**
 * Dialog Intelligence: cognitiveLoad=7, trustLevel=critical
 * Use for: Account deletion, data loss, irreversible actions  
 * Requires: Progressive confirmation patterns, clear escape hatches
 * Never use for: Simple confirmations, low-stakes decisions
 */
```

## AI Development Standards

- Read component intelligence before using ANY component
- Use semantic tokens exclusively (never arbitrary values)
- Follow the 7-file story architecture for new components
- Apply accessibility patterns systematically
- Validate with React 19 concurrent rendering requirements
