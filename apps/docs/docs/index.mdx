# Rafters

AI agents don't have taste. They guess at colors, spacing, hierarchy. **Rafters encodes designer judgment into queryable data** so AI doesn't guess - it reads decisions.

## Three Layers

- **What** (Components) - `@rafters/ui` with embedded intelligence
- **Where** (Tokens) - `@rafters/design-tokens` with dependency graph
- **Why** (Decisions) - Do/never patterns, cognitive load, trust

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @rafters/cli init
```

## Components

Browse the [component documentation](/components/) for live examples.
