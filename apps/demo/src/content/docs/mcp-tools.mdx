Rafters exposes design intelligence through three MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. Each serves a different query depth, enabling progressive disclosure of information.

## The Three Tools

### rafters_vocabulary

*"What do I have to work with?"*

Returns the available design vocabulary: color palettes, spacing scales, typography, components. An agent starting a new task calls this first to understand the design system's boundaries.

```json
{
  "colors": ["neutral", "accent", "destructive", "success", "warning"],
  "spacing": ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "8", "10", "12"],
  "components": ["Button", "Card", "Dialog", "Input", "Select", ...]
}
```

The agent now knows: use these colors, not arbitrary hex codes. Use these spacing values, not magic numbers.

### rafters_pattern

*"How do I implement this scenario?"*

Given a design pattern name (like `destructive-action` or `form-validation`), returns complete implementation guidance:

```json
{
  "intent": "Confirm before irreversible action",
  "components": ["AlertDialog", "Button"],
  "tokens": {
    "color": "destructive",
    "confirmDelay": "3000ms"
  },
  "cognitiveLoad": 6,
  "accessibility": "Requires keyboard confirmation path",
  "trustPattern": "Prevents accidental data loss",
  "guidance": {
    "do": [
      "Show what will be affected",
      "Require explicit confirmation text for high-stakes actions",
      "Provide undo when possible instead of confirmation"
    ],
    "never": [
      "Auto-confirm based on timeout",
      "Hide the cancel option",
      "Use destructive styling for reversible actions"
    ]
  }
}
```

The agent does not guess how to handle a destructive action. The designer has already decided.

### rafters_component

*"Tell me everything about this component."*

Returns complete intelligence for a specific component, parsed from its JSDoc metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "Button",
  "cognitiveLoad": {
    "score": 2,
    "description": "Familiar interaction pattern"
  },
  "attentionEconomics": "Use sparingly - each button competes for user attention",
  "trustBuilding": "Consistent behavior builds muscle memory",
  "accessibility": "Requires visible focus indicator, minimum 44px touch target",
  "usagePatterns": {
    "do": ["Use variant='destructive' only for irreversible actions"],
    "never": ["Stack more than 3 buttons horizontally"]
  },
  "example": "<Button variant=\"default\">Submit</Button>"
}
```

## Progressive Disclosure

The tools are ordered by specificity:

1. **Vocabulary** - Broad overview, minimal tokens
2. **Pattern** - Scenario-specific guidance, moderate detail  
3. **Component** - Complete implementation intelligence

An agent building a settings page might:
1. Query vocabulary to see available components
2. Query `form-validation` pattern for the settings form
3. Query `Input`, `Select`, `Button` components for specific implementation

Each query adds context without overwhelming the agent with irrelevant information.

## Why This Matters

Traditional design documentation is written for humans browsing. MCP tools are written for AI querying. The information is structured for retrieval, not reading.

An agent does not need to understand design principles. It needs to implement them correctly. These tools provide exactly the information required for correct implementation, no more, no less.
