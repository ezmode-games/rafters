AI agents guess at design. They pick colors that clash, spacing that feels off, hierarchy that confuses. They have no taste because taste cannot be prompted.

Rafters solves this by encoding a designer's judgment into queryable data. The AI does not guess. It reads decisions that have already been made.

## The Problem

When you ask an AI to build a UI, it reaches for patterns it has seen before. It knows Bootstrap exists. It knows Tailwind classes. It does not know *why* a destructive action should have a confirmation step, or *why* this particular shade of red communicates danger without being aggressive.

The AI is missing context that every junior designer learns in their first week: there are rules, but the rules serve purposes, and the purposes matter more than the rules.

## The Solution

Rafters provides three layers of intelligence:

**What** - The components themselves, with JSDoc metadata that describes cognitive load, accessibility requirements, and trust patterns.

**Where** - Design tokens with a dependency graph. When you change the base spacing unit, derived values update. When a human overrides a computed value, the system tracks *why*.

**Why** - Do and never patterns. Not just "use Button variant='destructive'" but "when the action is irreversible, require explicit confirmation and delay the submit by 3 seconds."

## How It Works

An AI agent queries Rafters through three MCP tools:

1. `rafters_vocabulary` - What colors, spacing, components exist
2. `rafters_pattern` - How to implement specific scenarios (destructive-action, form-validation, empty-state)
3. `rafters_component` - Full intelligence for a specific component

The agent learns what to do because the decisions are already made. It is not generating design. It is implementing design that a human defined.

## What Rafters Is Not

Rafters is not a component library. The components exist as proof the system works, but they are not the product.

Rafters is not a theme. Themes are veneer. Rafters encodes the grammar of design decisions so any vocabulary can be applied.

Rafters is not prescriptive. A designer can configure it to produce minimalist Swiss design or maximalist experimental interfaces. The protocol encodes judgment, not aesthetic.
