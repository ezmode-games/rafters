# Rafters AI Agent Instructions

## Design Intelligence System

This project uses Rafters components with embedded design intelligence. Each component includes reasoning about cognitive load, attention economics, and accessibility.

### How to Use Components

1. **Read component implementation** for technical details
2. **Check component comments** for essential intelligence patterns  
3. **Read intelligence stories** (if available) for complete design reasoning
4. **Reference manifest** for quick intelligence lookup

### Intelligence Patterns

Components include intelligence about:
- **Cognitive Load**: Mental overhead assessment (1-10 scale)
- **Attention Economics**: Visual hierarchy and prominence 
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA compliance with motor/visual/cognitive/auditory support
- **Trust Building**: Patterns for secure and sensitive interactions
- **Semantic Meaning**: How design communicates meaning beyond aesthetics

### Quick Reference

See `.rafters/component-manifest.json` for machine-readable intelligence data.

Read component stories in `./src/stories/` for complete design education.

### Design Principles

- **Intent → Meaning → Form → Implementation**
- **Accessibility as Foundation** (not an afterthought)
- **Cognitive Load Optimization** (reduce mental overhead)
- **Systems Over Solutions** (coherent design language)

These components are designed to teach design intelligence, not just provide functionality.
