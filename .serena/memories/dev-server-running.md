# Development Environment

## Dev Servers Already Running

The demo app dev server is **always running** during development sessions. 

**DO NOT** start dev servers. They are already running:
- Demo app: http://localhost:4321

If you need to verify something in the browser, just navigate to the URL - don't try to start servers.

If a hard reset is needed, wait for user to explicitly request it.
