# Quick AI Onboarding Commands
## Get a new AI agent up to speed in 60 seconds

**For a new AI agent in the component development window:**

## 1. Context Loading Commands (Copy/paste these)

```bash
# Read the design intelligence briefing
cat COMPONENT_DEVELOPMENT_BRIEFING.md

# Review existing component structure  
ls -la src/components/
cat src/components/Button.tsx

# Check current Storybook stories for intelligence patterns
ls -la src/stories/
cat src/stories/ButtonSemantic.stories.tsx

# Review design philosophy
cat DESIGN_INTELLIGENCE_PRIMER.md
cat DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md
```

## 2. Quick Intelligence Validation

Ask the new AI agent:

> "Review the COMPONENT_DEVELOPMENT_BRIEFING.md and existing Button component. Then create a LoginForm component that applies the design intelligence principles of cognitive load optimization, attention economics, and accessibility-first design. Document your design reasoning in a Storybook story."

## 3. Success Validation

The new AI should be able to:
- Explain WHY each design decision was made
- Apply cognitive load scoring (1-10 scale)
- Use attention economics for visual hierarchy
- Implement WCAG AAA accessibility
- Create Storybook stories that document design reasoning

## 4. Coordination with MCP Development

Both tracks should reference:
- `DESIGN_MASTER_MCP_ARCHITECTURE.md` for overall vision
- `DESIGN_INTELLIGENCE_PRIMER.md` for core principles
- `COMPONENT_DEVELOPMENT_BRIEFING.md` for component-specific intelligence

**The briefing document ensures any new AI agent can pick up exactly where we left off.**
