# Layout System

Systematic spatial relationships that create clear information hierarchy through golden ratio proportions and perceptual psychology.

## Foundation Principles

Layout systems operate through three core principles that guide both human designers and AI agents in creating predictable, effective spatial relationships.

### Golden Ratio Spacing
Mathematical proportions (φ = 1.618) create inherently balanced relationships that align with human perceptual boundaries.

### Gestalt Psychology
Proximity and similarity principles determine how elements group together in the mind, creating natural information architecture.

### Cognitive Load Management
Strategic use of negative space reduces cognitive burden while directing attention to what matters most.

## Spacing Hierarchy

Our spacing system uses four levels that correspond to psychological grouping boundaries. Each level communicates relationship strength through mathematical precision.

**φ⁰ - Unity (1rem)**: Elements perceived as a single unit or concept

**φ¹ - Related (1.618rem)**: Functionally connected but visually distinct elements  

**φ² - Separate (2.618rem)**: Clear conceptual separation with weak relationship

**φ³ - Isolated (4.236rem)**: Major structural divisions and strong separation

## Visual Scanning Patterns

Research-backed patterns that guide layout structure based on how users naturally scan content.

### F-Pattern Layout
For content-heavy pages, articles, forms. Users read horizontally then scan vertically down the left edge.

### Z-Pattern Layout  
For landing pages, conversion flows, action-focused content. Eyes follow diagonal path from top-left to bottom-right.

## Layout Examples

### Golden Proportions

### Container Variants
<Canvas of={Stories.ContainerVariants} />

## Implementation Rules

**Related Content**: Use φ⁰ to φ¹ spacing (1rem to 1.618rem) for elements that belong to the same concept or workflow step.

**Functional Groups**: Use φ¹ to φ² spacing (1.618rem to 2.618rem) for distinct but related sections like form groups or navigation clusters.

**Major Sections**: Use φ² to φ³ spacing (2.618rem to 4.236rem) for primary structural divisions like header, main content, and footer.

## CSS Utilities

### Spacing Classes
- `gap-phi-1` → 1.618rem
- `gap-phi-2` → 2.618rem  
- `gap-phi-3` → 4.236rem
- `p-phi-1` → 1.618rem padding
- `m-phi-2` → 2.618rem margin
