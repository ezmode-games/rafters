# Dialog
Dialogs are used to display critical information, confirm user actions, or collect input while maintaining focus and context. A dialog creates a focused interaction space that temporarily overlays the main interface, demanding attention for important decisions or information. The component is built with trust-building patterns that reduce user anxiety during consequential moments.

## Usage Guidelines
Dialogs should be used sparingly and only for truly important interactions that require user attention. The primary purpose is to create a focused space for critical decisions, confirmations, or essential information collection.

#### DOs
- **Dialog Purpose**
  - Use for confirmations of destructive or irreversible actions
  - Display critical information that requires immediate attention
  - Collect essential information that blocks workflow continuation
  - Provide progressive disclosure for complex multi-step processes
- **Trust Building**
  - Always include clear escape routes (close buttons, cancel options)
  - Explain consequences of actions before confirmation
  - Use appropriate trust levels for the sensitivity of the operation
  - Provide visual hierarchy that matches the importance of the decision
- **Content Structure**
  - Use descriptive titles that clearly state the dialog's purpose
  - Include helpful descriptions that explain what will happen
  - Organize content to reduce cognitive load and decision fatigue
  - Maintain consistent button placement and hierarchy

#### DON'Ts
- **Dialog Misuse**
  - Don't use dialogs for non-critical information or notifications
  - Avoid dialogs for simple confirmations that could be inline
  - Don't stack multiple dialogs on top of each other
  - Avoid dialogs that can be replaced with inline editing or immediate feedback
- **Trust Violations**
  - Never trap users without clear escape routes
  - Don't use misleading or unclear action labels
  - Avoid hiding important consequences or side effects
  - Don't use destructive actions without appropriate confirmation patterns
- **Accessibility Violations**
  - Don't break keyboard navigation or focus management
  - Avoid insufficient color contrast or touch target sizes
  - Don't rely solely on color to convey important information
  - Never ignore screen reader accessibility requirements

#### Use Cases
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Delete account, cancel subscription, publish content
- **Trust-Building Operations**: Payment processing, data export, account linking
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Multi-step wizards, complex form sections
- **Critical Alerts**: System errors, security warnings, data loss prevention
- **Information Collection**: Settings configuration, preference updates, feedback forms

#### Trust Levels
- **Low**: Simple confirmations, non-destructive actions, preference changes
- **Medium**: Content publishing, data modifications, account changes
- **High**: Payment processing, sensitive data access, subscription changes
- **Critical**: Account deletion, data destruction, security-sensitive operations
