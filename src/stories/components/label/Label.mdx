# Label Component

Labels deliver clear, helpful information that guides users through interface interactions. They create semantic relationships between descriptive text and interface elements without emotional manipulation.

## Design Philosophy

Labels exist to inform, not persuade. They build trust through consistent, accurate information delivery that helps users understand what they're looking at and what they need to do.

### Core Principles

**Pure Information**
Labels focus solely on delivering the information users need. No persuasion, no emotional manipulation - just clear, helpful communication that builds understanding.

**Semantic Relationships**
Labels create meaningful connections between descriptive text and interface elements through proper HTML relationships and ARIA attributes.

**Consistent Language**
Similar situations use similar language patterns. Users learn to trust the system because it communicates predictably and helpfully.

## When to Use Labels

✅ **DO use labels for:**
- Form field identification and guidance
- Status and state communication
- Data identification and context
- Meta information (timestamps, counts, attribution)
- System feedback and validation messages

❌ **DON'T use labels for:**
- Marketing copy or persuasive content
- Decorative text elements
- Brand messaging
- Content that's primarily visual hierarchy

## Content Guidelines

### Form Field Labels

**Field Identification:**
- Use clear, specific nouns: "Email Address" not "Email"
- Avoid questions: "Full Name" not "What's your name?"
- Be consistent: if you use "Phone Number" once, use it everywhere

**Hint Messages:**
- Explain the purpose: "We'll use this for account recovery"
- Clarify format requirements: "Must include area code"
- Be helpful, not defensive: "This helps us..." not "We need this because..."

**Validation Messages:**
- Be specific about the problem: "Email address must include @"
- Suggest a solution: "Try user@example.com format"
- Stay calm and helpful: "Please check..." not "Error!"

**Placeholder Text:**
- Show format examples: "user@company.com"
- Don't repeat the label: if label is "Email", placeholder shouldn't be "Enter email"
- Use realistic examples that users can relate to

### Status and Meta Labels

**Status Communication:**
- Use clear, plain language: "Processing" not "Executing workflow"
- Be honest about timing: "This may take a few minutes"
- Explain what's happening: "Saving your changes..."

**Timestamps:**
- Use relative time when helpful: "2 hours ago"
- Switch to absolute dates for older content: "March 15, 2024"
- Be consistent with format choices

**Counts and Quantities:**
- Use natural language: "5 unread messages" not "5 unread"
- Handle singular/plural correctly
- Group large numbers appropriately: "1,247 items"

### System Feedback

**Success Messages:**
- Confirm what happened: "Profile updated successfully"
- Be brief but complete
- Use active voice when possible

**Error Communication:**
- Explain what went wrong without technical jargon
- Suggest next steps when possible
- Take responsibility: "We couldn't process..." not "You failed to..."

**Loading States:**
- Tell users what's happening: "Loading your dashboard..."
- Set expectations: "This usually takes about 30 seconds"
- Stay encouraging for longer processes

## Language Patterns

### Consistent Vocabulary

**Use the same terms for the same concepts:**
- If you call it "Dashboard" in navigation, call it "Dashboard" everywhere
- Pick one term for each concept and stick with it
- Create a vocabulary list for your product

**Standard Phrases for Common Situations:**
- Required fields: "This field is required"
- Invalid format: "Please check the format"
- Success actions: "[Action] completed successfully"
- Loading states: "Loading your [content]..."

### Helpful, Not Clever

**Choose clarity over creativity:**
- "Save Changes" not "Commit Updates"
- "Delete Account" not "Say Goodbye"
- "Upload Photo" not "Add Your Beautiful Face"

**Be appropriately formal:**
- Match your product's tone, but lean toward helpful clarity
- Avoid slang or cultural references that might not translate
- Write for comprehension, not entertainment

## Accessibility Integration

### Semantic HTML

Labels use proper HTML relationships:
- `<label for="input-id">` for form controls
- `aria-labelledby` for complex relationships
- `aria-describedby` for additional context

### Screen Reader Optimization

- Write labels that make sense when read aloud
- Include context that might be visually obvious
- Use descriptive text for icon meanings

### Internationalization

- Write labels that translate well
- Avoid idioms or cultural references
- Keep sentence structures simple and clear

## Implementation

Labels handle the **what to say** and **semantic relationships**. Visual presentation comes from Typography components that Label uses internally.

```jsx
// Label manages content and semantics
<Label htmlFor="email" variant="field">Email Address</Label>
<Label variant="hint">We'll use this for account recovery</Label>
<Label variant="error">Please enter a valid email address</Label>

// Typography handles visual presentation
<Label variant="field" typography="form-label">Email Address</Label>
```

Labels build trust through reliability - users learn they can depend on consistent, helpful information that guides them toward success.
